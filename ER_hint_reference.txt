Hint description:

Hints will appear in the following ratios across the 15 telepathic tiles that have hints and the five storyteller locations:

4 hints for inconvenient entrances.
4 hints for random entrances (this can by coincidence pick inconvenient entrances that aren't used for the first set of hints).
3 hints for inconvenient item locations.
5 hints for valuable items.
4 junk hints.

In the vanilla, dungeonssimple, and dungeonsfull shuffles, the following ratios will be used instead:

5 hints for inconvenient item locations.
8 hints for valuable items.
7 junk hints.

In the simple, restricted, and restricted legacy shuffles, these are the ratios:

2 hints for inconvenient entrances.
1 hint for an inconvenient dungeon entrance.
4 hints for random entrances (this can by coincidence pick inconvenient entrances that aren't used for the first set of hints).
3 hints for inconvenient item locations.
5 hints for valuable items.
5 junk hints.

These hints will use the following format:

Entrance hints go "[Entrance on overworld] leads to [interior]".

Inconvenient item locations are a little more custom but amount to "[Location] has [item name]". The item name is literal and will specify which dungeon the dungeon specific items hail from (small key/big key/map/compass).

The valuable items are of the format "[item name] can be found [location]". The item name is again literal, and the location text is taken from Ganon's silver arrow hints. Note that the way it works is that every unique valuable item that exists is considered independently, and you won't get multiple hints for the EXACT same item (so you can only get one hint for Progressive Sword no matter how many swords exist in the seed, but if swords are not progressive, you could get hints for both Master Sword and Tempered Sword). More copies of an item existing does not increase the probability of getting a hint for that particular item (you are equally likely to get a hint for a Progressive Sword as for the Hammer). Unlike the IR, item names are never obfuscated by "something unique", and there is no special bias for hints for GT Big Key or Pegasus Boots.
