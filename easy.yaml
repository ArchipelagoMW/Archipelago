accessibility:
  items: 0 # item accessibility means you can get all inventory items. So a key could lock itself, but you can fill your inventory
  locations: 1 # location accessibility means you can access every location in your seed and get all 216 checks
  none: 0 # no accessibility means your seed is "beatable only", meaning any items you do not need to beat the game can be unreachable. This can mean you have to defeat ganon with a lamp and master sword.
progressive: #not available in bonta's multiworld at this time. If you want this option, make sure the host uses the correct Multiworld
  on: 1 # progressive items, you will always get progressive items like swords in their order: figher sword -> master sword -> tempered sword -> golden sword
  off: 0 # turns progressive items off, so you can find, for example, silver arrows before a bow
  random: 0 # rolls a 50/50 chance for each potentially progressive item. So, for example, you can have progressive swords but non-progressive mittens
entrance_shuffle:
  none: 1 # no entrance shuffle
  simple: 0 #dungeons are shuffled with each other and the other entrances are shuffled with each other
  restricted: 0 #dungeons still shuffle along each other but connects other entrances more feely with each other while keeping entrances in one world
  full: 0 # mixes caves and dungeons freely, except for confining all entrances to one world
  crossed: 0 #introduces cross world connectors
  insanity: 0 #any entrance can lead to any other entrance
goals:
  ganon: 5 #beat GT and then Ganon
  fast_ganon: 4 # Just kill Ganon
  dungeons: 1 # All Dungeons, including GT, and Agahnims Tower
  pedestal: 0 # Pull the win out of the Pedestal
  triforce-hunt: 0 # Collect 20 of 30 Triforce pieces then hand them in in front of Hyrule Castle

  inverted: 0 # You start in the Dark World, the Light World has changes to it's Map and requires a Moon Pearl to not be Bunny
  retro: 0 # Keys are universal, you have to buy a quiver, there are take any caves and some other changes. Makes it more like Z1
