# What is this file?
# This file contains options which allow you to configure your multiworld experience while allowing others
# to play how they want as well.
#
# How do I use it?
# The options in this file are weighted. This means the higher number you assign to a value, the more
# chances you have for that option to be chosen. For example, an option like this:
#
# map_shuffle:
#   on: 5
#   off: 15
#
# Means you have 5 chances for map shuffle to not occur, and 15 chances for map shuffle to be turned on

# I've never seen a file like this before. What characters am I allowed to use?
# This is a .yaml file. You are allowed to use most characters.
# To test if your yaml is valid or not, you can use this website:
# http://www.yamllint.com/

description: Farrak's Easy Example # Used to describe your yaml. Useful if you have multiple files

item_placement: basic # This is based on Entrance Randomizer, which does not (yet?) support advanced
meta_ignore: # Nullify options specified in the meta.yaml file. Adding an option here guarantees it will not occur in your seed, even if the .yaml file specifies it

    - inverted # Never play inverted seeds
    - retro # Never play retry seeds
