# Archipelago General Client
## Archipelago Connection Handshake
These steps should be followed in order to establish a gameplay connection with an Archipelago session.

1. Client establishes WebSocket connection to Archipelago server.
2. Server accepts connection and responds with a [RoomInfo](#RoomInfo) packet.
3. Client may send a [GetDataPackage](#GetDataPackage) packet.
4. Server sends a [DataPackage](#DataPackage) packet in return. (If the client sent GetDataPackage.)
5. Client sends [Connect](#Connect) packet in order to authenticate with the server.
6. Server validates the client's packet and responds with [Connected](#Connected) or [ConnectionRefused](#ConnectionRefused).
7. Server may send [ReceivedItems](#ReceivedItems) to the client, in the case that the client is missing items that are queued up for it.
8. Server sends [Print](#Print) to all players to notify them of the new client connection.

In the case that the client does not authenticate properly and receives a [ConnectionRefused](#ConnectionRefused) then the server will maintain the connection and allow for follow-up [Connect](#Connect) packet.

There are libraries available that implement this network protocol in [Python](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/blob/main/CommonClient.py), [Java](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago.MultiClient.Java) and [.Net](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago.MultiClient.Net)

For Super Nintendo games there are clients available in either [Node](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/SuperNintendoClient) or [Python](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/blob/main/SNIClient.py), There are also game specific clients available for [The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Z5Client) or [Final Fantasy 1](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/blob/main/FF1Client.py)

## Synchronizing Items
When the client receives a [ReceivedItems](#ReceivedItems) packet, if the `index` argument does not match the next index that the client expects then it is expected that the client will re-sync items with the server. This can be accomplished by sending the server a [Sync](#Sync) packet and then a [LocationChecks](#LocationChecks) packet.

Even if the client detects a desync, it can still accept the items provided in this packet to prevent gameplay interruption.

When the client receives a [ReceivedItems](#ReceivedItems) packet and the `index` arg is `0` (zero) then the client should accept the provided `items` list as its full inventory. (Abandon previous inventory.)

# Archipelago Protocol Packets
Packets are sent between the multiworld server and client in order to sync information between them. Below is a directory of each packet.

Packets are simple JSON lists in which any number of ordered network commands can be sent, which are objects. Each command has a "cmd" key, indicating its purpose. All packet argument types documented here refer to JSON types, unless otherwise specified.

An object can contain the "class" key, which will tell the content data type, such as "Version" in the following example.

Example:
```javascript
[{"cmd": "RoomInfo", "version": {"major": 0, "minor": 1, "build": 3, "class": "Version"}, "tags": ["WebHost"], ... }]
```

## Appendix

### Coop
Coop in Archipelago is automatically facilitated by the server, however some of the default behaviour may not be what you desire.

If the game in question is a remote-items game (attribute on AutoWorld), then all items will always be sent and received.
If the game in question is not a remote-items game, then any items that are placed within the same world will not be send by the server.

To manually react to others in the same player slot doing checks, listen to [RoomUpdate](#RoomUpdate) -> checked_locations.

### NetworkPlayer
A list of objects. Each object denotes one player. Each object has four fields about the player, in this order: `team`, `slot`, `alias`, and `name`. `team` and `slot` are ints, `alias` and `name` are strs.

Each player belongs to a `team` and has a `slot`. Team numbers start at `0`. Slot numbers are unique per team and start at `1`. Slot number `0` refers to the Archipelago server; this may appear in instances where the server grants the player an item.

`alias` represents the player's name in current time. `name` is the original name used when the session was generated. This is typically distinct in games which require baking names into ROMs or for async games.

```python
from typing import NamedTuple
class NetworkPlayer(NamedTuple):
    team: int
    slot: int
    alias: str
    name: str
```

Example:
```js
[
    {"team": 0, "slot": 1, "alias": "Lord MeowsiePuss", "name": "Meow"}, 
    {"team": 0, "slot": 2, "alias": "Doggo", "name": "Bork"},
    {"team": 1, "slot": 1, "alias": "Angry Duck", "name": "Angry Quack"},
    {"team": 1, "slot": 2, "alias": "Mountain Duck", "name": "Honk"}
]
```

### NetworkItem
Items that are sent over the net (in packets) use the following data structure and are sent as objects:
```python
from typing import NamedTuple
class NetworkItem(NamedTuple):
    item: int
    location: int
    player: int
    flags: int
```
In JSON this may look like:
```js
[
    {"item": 1, "location": 1, "player": 0, "flags": 1},
    {"item": 2, "location": 2, "player": 0, "flags": 2},
    {"item": 3, "location": 3, "player": 0, "flags": 0}
]
```
`item` is the item id of the item

`location` is the location id of the item inside the world

`player` is the player slot of the world the item is located in

`flags` are bit flags:
| Flag | Meaning |
| ----- | ----- |
| 0 | Nothing special about this item |
| 0b001 | If set, indicates the item can unlock logical advancement |
| 0b010 | If set, indicates the item is important but not in a way that unlocks advancement |
| 0b100 | If set, indicates the item is a trap |

### JSONMessagePart
Message nodes sent along with [PrintJSON](#PrintJSON) packet to be reconstructed into a legible message. The nodes are intended to be read in the order they are listed in the packet.

```python
from typing import TypedDict, Optional
class JSONMessagePart(TypedDict):
    type: Optional[str]
    text: Optional[str]
    color: Optional[str] # only available if type is a color
    flags: Optional[int] # only available if type is an item_id or item_name
    player: Optional[int] # only available if type is either item or location
```

`type` is used to denote the intent of the message part. This can be used to indicate special information which may be rendered differently depending on client. How these types are displayed in Archipelago's ALttP client is not the end-all be-all. Other clients may choose to interpret and display these messages differently.
Possible values for `type` include:

| Name | Notes |
| ---- | ----- |
| text | Regular text content. Is the default type and as such may be omitted. |
| player_id | player ID of someone on your team, should be resolved to Player Name |
| player_name | Player Name, could be a player within a multiplayer game or from another team, not ID resolvable |
| item_id | Item ID, should be resolved to Item Name |
| item_name | Item Name, not currently used over network, but supported by reference Clients. |
| location_id | Location ID, should be resolved to Location Name |
| location_name | Location Name, not currently used over network, but supported by reference Clients. |
| entrance_name | Entrance Name. No ID mapping exists. |
| color | Regular text that should be colored. Only `type` that will contain `color` data. |


`color` is used to denote a console color to display the message part with and is only send if the `type` is `color`. This is limited to console colors due to backwards compatibility needs with games such as ALttP. Although background colors as well as foreground colors are listed, only one may be applied to a [JSONMessagePart](#JSONMessagePart) at a time.

Color options:
* bold
* underline
* black
* red
* green
* yellow
* blue
* magenta
* cyan
* white
* black_bg
* red_bg
* green_bg
* yellow_bg
* blue_bg
* purple_bg
* cyan_bg
* white_bg

`text` is the content of the message part to be displayed.
`player` marks owning player id for location/item, 
`flags` contains the [NetworkItem](#NetworkItem) flags that belong to the item

### Client States
An enumeration containing the possible client states that may be used to inform the server in [StatusUpdate](#StatusUpdate).

```python
import enum
class ClientStatus(enum.IntEnum):
    CLIENT_UNKNOWN = 0
    CLIENT_READY = 10
    CLIENT_PLAYING = 20
    CLIENT_GOAL = 30
```

### NetworkVersion
An object representing software versioning. Used in the [Connect](#Connect) packet to allow the client to inform the server of the Archipelago version it supports.
```python
from typing import NamedTuple
class Version(NamedTuple):
    major: int
    minor: int
    build: int
```

### Permission
An enumeration containing the possible command permission, for commands that may be restricted. 
```python
import enum
class Permission(enum.IntEnum):
    disabled = 0b000  # 0, completely disables access
    enabled = 0b001  # 1, allows manual use
    goal = 0b010  # 2, allows manual use after goal completion
    auto = 0b110  # 6, forces use after goal completion, only works for forfeit and collect
    auto_enabled = 0b111  # 7, forces use after goal completion, allows manual use any time
```

### Data Package Contents
A data package is a JSON object which may contain arbitrary metadata to enable a client to interact with the Archipelago server most easily. Currently, this package is used to send ID to name mappings so that clients need not maintain their own mappings.

We encourage clients to cache the data package they receive on disk, or otherwise not tied to a session. You will know when your cache is outdated if the [RoomInfo](#RoomInfo) packet or the datapackage itself denote a different version. A special case is datapackage version 0, where it is expected the package is custom and should not be cached.

Note: 
 * Any ID is unique to its type across AP: Item 56 only exists once and Location 56 only exists once.
 * Any Name is unique to its type across its own Game only: Single Arrow can exist in two games.
 * The IDs from the game "Archipelago" may be used in any other game. 
   Especially Location ID -1: Cheat Console and -2: Server (typically Remote Start Inventory)

#### Contents
| Name | Type | Notes |
| ------ | ----- | ------ |
| games | dict[str, GameData] | Mapping of all Games and their respective data |
| version | int | Sum of all per-game version numbers, for clients that don't bother with per-game caching/updating. |

#### GameData
GameData is a **dict** but contains these keys and values. It's broken out into another "type" for ease of documentation.

| Name | Type | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----- |
| item_name_to_id | dict[str, int] | Mapping of all item names to their respective ID. |
| location_name_to_id | dict[str, int] | Mapping of all location names to their respective ID. |
| version | int | Version number of this game's data |

### Tags
Tags are represented as a list of strings, the common Client tags follow:

| Name | Notes |
| ----- | ---- |
| AP | Signifies that this client is a reference client, its usefulness is mostly in debugging to compare client behaviours more easily. |
| IgnoreGame | Tells the server to ignore the "game" attribute in the [Connect](#Connect) packet. |
| DeathLink | Client participates in the DeathLink mechanic, therefore will send and receive DeathLink bounce packets |
| Tracker | Tells the server that this client is actually a Tracker, will refuse new locations from this client and send all items as if they were remote items. |
| TextOnly | Tells the server that this client will not send locations and does not want to receive items. |

### DeathLink
A special kind of Bounce packet that can be supported by any AP game. It targets the tag "DeathLink" and carries the following data:

| Name | Type | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| time | float | Unix Time Stamp of time of death. |
| cause | str | Optional. Text to explain the cause of death, ex. "Berserker was run over by a train." |
| source | str | Name of the player who first died. Can be a slot name, but can also be a name from within a multiplayer game. |
