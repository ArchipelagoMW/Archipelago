# Wario Land 4

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the
options you need to configure and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

The 72 jewel pieces, 16 CDs, one full health item, and eight of Wario's moves
are now shuffled into the item pool where any player can find them.

## What is the goal of Wario Land 4 when randomized?

Defeat the Golden Diva and steal the Golden Pyramid's treasure!

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any shuffled item can be in other players' worlds.

## What does another world's item look like in Wario Land 4?

Other games' items will look like Archipelago logos. When collected from a box, the item's name will
be displayed at the bottom left corner of the screen.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

If you receive a jewel piece or CD in a level, the game will show you what you got using a similar
display to when you take one from a chest. Unlike when the item is in a box, the item will be
available to be used immediately, rather than only after exiting the level. On the pyramid screen,
there will be a display using a pop-up window to tell the player what they received. If the item is
junk, Wario will receive it the next time he enters a level, or immediately if he's already in one.
