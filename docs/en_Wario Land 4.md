# Wario Land 4

## Where is the settings page?

options you need to configure and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

The 72 jewel pieces, 16 CDs, and 5 to 9 full health items (depending on difficulty) are now shuffled
into the item pool where any player can find them.

## What is the goal of Wario Land 4 when randomized?

Defeat the Golden Diva and steal the Golden Pyramid's treasure!

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any shuffled item can be in other players' worlds.

## What does another world's item look like in Wario Land 4?

Other games' items will look like silver CDs.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

Currently, it isn't obvious when the player receives an item. Jewel pieces and CDs are granted as
soon as they're received. If Wario is in a level, junk items will be granted immediately; otherwise,
they will be queued and granted the next time he enters one.
