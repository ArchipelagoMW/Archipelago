# Wario Land 4

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the
options you need to configure and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

The 72 jewel pieces, 16 CDs, and 5 to 9 full health items (depending on difficulty) are now shuffled
into the item pool where any player can find them.

## What is the goal of Wario Land 4 when randomized?

Defeat the Golden Diva and steal the Golden Pyramid's treasure!

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any shuffled item can be in other players' worlds.

## What does another world's item look like in Wario Land 4?

Other games' items will look like Archipelago logos.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

If you receive a jewel piece or CD in a level, the game will show you what you got using a similar
display to when you take one from a chest. On the pyramid screen, a sound effect and Wario voice
clip will play. If the item is junk, Wario will receive it the next time he enters a level, or
immediately if he's already in one.
