# APWorld Dev FAQ

This document is meant as a reference tool to show solutions to common problems when developing an apworld.

### My game has a restrictive start that leads to fill errors

Hint to the Generator that an item needs to be in sphere one with local_early_items
```
early_item_name = "Sword"
self.multiworld.local_early_items[self.player][early_item_name] = 1
```

### I have multiple settings that change the item/location pool counts and need to balance them out

In an ideal situation your system for producing locations and items wouldn't leave any opportunity for them to be unbalanced. But in real, complex situations, that might be unfeasible.

If that's the case, you can create extra filler based on the difference between your unfilled locations and your itempool by comparing [get_unfilled_locations](/BaseClasses.py) to your list of items to submit

Note: to use self.create_filler(), self.get_filler_item_name() should be defined to only return valid filler item names
```
total_locations = len(self.multiworld.get_unfilled_locations(self.player))
item_pool = self.create_non_filler_items()

while len(item_pool) < total_locations:
    item_pool.append(self.create_filler())

self.multiworld.itempool += item_pool
```
