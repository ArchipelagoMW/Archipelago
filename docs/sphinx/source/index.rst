Archipelago API Reference
=========================

Archipelago is still under development, so the API is subject to change. As such, there exists both
`stable <https://archipelago.gg/docs>`_ and `bleeding edge <https://ArchipelagoMW.github.io/Archipelago>`_ versions of
this reference document.

Get Started

The first thing you should do to get started with Archipelago is to read the :doc:`contributing` which cover
the requirements of not only contributing to the main project, but the requirements and expectations of a world as well.
