# Deploy Using Containers

If you just want to play and there is a compiled version available on the [Archipelago releases page](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases), use that version.
To build the full Archipelago software stack, refer to [Running From Source](running%20from%20source.md).
Follow these steps to build and deploy a containerized instance of the web host software, optionally integrating [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) WSGI HTTP Server running behind the [nginx](https://nginx.org/) reverse proxy.


## Building the Container Image

What you'll need:
 * A container runtime engine such as:
   * [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
   * [Podman](https://podman.io/)

Starting from the root repository directory, the standalone Archipelago image can be built and run with the command:
`docker build -t archipelago .`
Or:
`podman build -t archipelago .`

It is recommended to tag the image using `-t` to more easily identify the image and run it.


## Running the Container

Running the container can be performed using:
`docker run --network host archipelago`
Or:
`podman run --network host archipelago`

The Archipelago web host requires access to multiple ports in order to host game servers simultaneously. To simplify configuration for this purpose, specify `--network host`.

Given the default configuration, the website will be accessible at the hostname/IP address (localhost if run locally) of the machine being deployed to, at port 80. It can be configured by creating a YAML file and mapping a volume to the container when running initially:
`docker run archipelago --network host -v /path/to/config.yaml:/app/config.yaml`
See `docs/webhost configuration sample.yaml` for example.


## Using Docker Compose

An example [docker compose](../deploy/docker-compose.yml) file can be found in [deploy](../deploy), along with example configuration files used by the services it orchestrates. Using these files as-is will spin up two separate archipelago containers with special modifications to their runtime arguments, in addition to deploying an `nginx` reverse proxy container.

To deploy in this manner, from the ["deploy"](../deploy) directory, run:
`docker compose up -d`

### Services

The `docker-compose.yaml` file defines three services:
  * multiworld:
    * Executes the main `WebHost` process, using the [example config](../deploy/example_config.yaml), and overriding with a secondary [selflaunch example config](../deploy/example_selflaunch.yaml). This is because we do not want to launch the website through this service.
  * web:
    * Executes `gunicorn` using its [example config](../deploy/example_gunicorn.conf.py), which will bind it to the `WebHost` application, in effect launching it.
    * We mount the main [config](../deploy/example_config.yaml) without an override to specify that we are launching the website through this service.
    * No ports are exposed through to the host.
  * nginx:
    * Serves as a reverse proxy with `web` as its upstream.
    * Directs all HTTP traffic from port 80 to the upstream service.
    * Exposed to the host on port 8080. This is where we can reach the website.

### Configuration

As these are examples, they can be copied and modified. For instance setting the value of `HOST_ADDRESS` in [example config](../deploy/example_config.yaml) to host machines local IP address, will expose the service to its local area network.

The configuration files may be modified to handle for machine-specific optimizations, such as:
  * Web pages responding too slowly
    * Edit [the gunicorn config](../deploy/example_gunicorn.conf.py) to increase thread and/or worker count.
  * Game generation stalls
    * Increase the generator count in [selflaunch config](../deploy/example_selflaunch.yaml)
  * Gameplay lags
    * Increase the hoster count in [selflaunch config](../deploy/example_selflaunch.yaml)

Changes made to `docker-compose.yaml` can be applied by running `docker compose up -d`, while those made to other files are applied by running `docker compose restart`.


## Windows

It is possible to carry out these deployment steps on Windows under [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).


## Optional: A Link to the Past Enemizer

Only required to generate seeds that include A Link to the Past with certain options enabled. You will receive an
error if it is required.
Enemizer can be enabled on `x86_64` platform architecture, and is included in the image build process. Enemizer requires a version 1.0 Japanese "Zelda no Densetsu" `.sfc` rom file to be placed in the application directory:
`docker run archipelago -v "/path/to/zelda.sfc:/app/Zelda no Densetsu - Kamigami no Triforce (Japan).sfc"`.
Enemizer is not currently available for `aarch64`.


## Optional: Git

Building the image requires a local copy of the ArchipelagoMW source code.
Refer to [Running From Source](running%20from%20source.md#optional-git).
