# Contributing
Contributions are welcome. We have a few requests of any new contributors.

* **Ensure that all changes are covered by unit tests.** 
It is strongly recommended that unit tests are used to avoid regression and to ensure everything is still working.
If you wish to contribute by adding a new game, please take a look at the [logic unit test documentation](/docs/world%20api.md#tests).
If you wish to contribute to the website, please take a look at these [following tests](/tree/main/test/webhost).
* **Do not introduce any unit test failures/regressions.**
To do so, it is recommended that Github actions are turned on to automatically run all unit tests when pushing.
You can turn this setting on here. (insert image)

* **Follow styling guidelines.**
We have designated styling guideline to ensure uniformity and ease of communication. Please take a look at 
our [styling documentation](/docs/style.md).

Other than these requests, we tend to judge code on a case to case basis. For contribution to the website, please also refer to
this [document](/WebHostLib/README.md).

If you want to contribute to the core, you will be subject to stricter review on your pull requests. It is also recommended
that you get in touch with other core mainteners via our [Discord](https://archipelago.gg/discord).

If you want to add a new game to Archipelago, please take a look at this [document](/docs/adding%20games.md) detailing what is required 
for implementing a game (as well as tips for how to get started).
If you want to merge a new game, please make sure to read the responsibilities as
[world maintainer](/docs/world%20maintainer.md).

For any other questions, feel free to explore the [main documentation folder](/docs/) and ask us questions in the #archipelago-dev channel 
of our [Discord](https://archipelago.gg/discord).
