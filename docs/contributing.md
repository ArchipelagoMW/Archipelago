# Contributing
Contributions are welcome. We have a few requests of any new contributors.

* Ensure that all changes which affect logic are covered by unit tests. 
* Do not introduce any unit test failures/regressions.
* Follow styling as designated in our [styling documentation](/docs/style.md).

Otherwise, we tend to judge code on a case to case basis.

For adding a new game to Archipelago and other documentation on how Archipelago functions, please see 
[the docs folder](/docs/) for the relevant information and feel free to ask any questions in the #archipelago-dev 
channel in our [Discord](https://archipelago.gg/discord).
If you want to merge a new game, please make sure to read the responsibilities as
[world maintainer](/docs/world%20maintainer.md).
