        Test that generation is deterministic across multiple generations on the same process.

        Many worlds have constant, shared data used to create locations/regions/etc. and to set up logic that should not
        be modified across multiple generations.

        This test generates a different seed in-between two generations of the same seed and ensures that the two
        generations of the same seed produced identical results.

        Failing this test often means that a world will not generate correctly when there are multiple worlds of that
        game in one multiworld.

        Usage of the `random` module directly within worlds is unsafe because its Random instance can be used by
        libraries and more in nondeterministic ways. Worlds should use their own Random instance, either `.random` or
        `.multiworld.random`, instead. Alternatively, to work with libraries that perform randomization, worlds should
        pass a deterministic seed to the libraries or pass a new Random instance using a deterministic seed.
