        Test that generation is likely deterministic on webhost, specifically that it does not use the `random` module
        directly.

        Usage of the `random` module directly within worlds is unsafe because its Random instance can be used by
        libraries and more in nondeterministic ways. Worlds should use their own Random instance, either `.random` or
        `.multiworld.random`, instead. Alternatively, to work with libraries that perform randomization, worlds should
        pass a deterministic seed to the libraries or pass a new Random instance using a deterministic seed.

        It may be possible for worlds to call `random.seed(deterministic_seed)` before running library functions, but
        this should be considered a last resort.

        Failing this test means that a world will generate nondeterministically on webhost (archipelago.gg and other
        hosts of the website generator).
