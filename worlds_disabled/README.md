## Folder Purpose

This folder is for already merged worlds that are unmaintained and currently broken. If you are interested in fixing and
stepping up as maintainer for any of these worlds, please review the [world maintainer](/docs/world%20maintainer.md)
documentation.

## Rationale for Disabled Worlds

Listed below is the reason for each world being disabled. For a world to be considered for reactivation, all concerns
should be addressed, however this requirement does not guarantee reactivation in and of itself. Depending on the age 
of the disabled worlds, additional issues may need to be handled that were not present previously.

  * World fails tests if world was not `hidden`
  * No client exists for world
  * No maintainer for world
