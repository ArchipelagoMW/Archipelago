## Folder Purpose

This folder is for already merged worlds that are unmaintained and currently broken. If you are interested in fixing and
stepping up as maintainer for any of these worlds, please review the [world maintainer](/docs/world%20maintainer.md)
documentation.

## Information for Disabled Worlds

For each disabled world, a README file can be found detailing when the world was disabled and the reasons that it
was disabled. In order to be considered for reactivation, these concerns should be handled at a bare minimum. However,
each world may have additional issues that also need to be handled, such as deprecated API calls or missing components.
