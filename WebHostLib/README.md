# WebHost

## Contribution Guidelines
**Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Archipelago website!**  
Much of the content on the website is generated automatically, but there are some things
that need a personal touch. For those things, we rely on contributions from both the core
team and the community. The current primary maintainer of the website is Farrak Kilhn.
He may be found on Discord as `Farrak Kilhn#0418`, or on GitHub as `LegendaryLinux`.

### Small Changes
Pull requests for small changes to the website are almost always accepted. These include things
like spelling and grammar corrections, bugfixes, etc. 

### Content Additions
Once you develop a new feature or add new content the website, make a pull request. It will
be reviewed by the community and there will probably be some discussion around it. Depending
on the size of the feature, and if new styles are required, there may be an additional step
before the PR is accepted wherein Farrak works with the designer to implement styles.

### Style Changes
While content and feature changes to the website are commonly accepted, style changes are not.
A professional designer has designed the assets, colors, themes, etc. for the website. In an
effort to maintain a consistent look and feel, style changes are largely not accepted. Please
note this applies to code which changes the look and feel of the site, not to small tweaks to
CSS for your custom page.

### Site Themes
There are several themes available for game pages. It is possible to request a new theme in
the `#art-and-design` channel on Discord. Because themes are created by the designer, they
are not free, and take some time to create. Farrak works closely with the designer to implement
these themes, and pays for the assets out of pocket. Therefore, only a couple themes per year
are added. If a proposed theme seems like a cool idea and the community likes it, there is a
good chance it will become a reality.
