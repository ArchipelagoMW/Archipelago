# WebHost

## Asset License

The image files used in the page design were specifically designed for archipelago.gg and are **not** covered by the top
level LICENSE.
See individual LICENSE files in `./static/static/**`.

You are only allowed to use them for personal use, testing and development.
If the site is reachable over the internet, have a robots.txt in place (see `ASSET_RIGHTS` in `config.yaml`)
and do not promote it publicly. Alternatively replace or remove the assets.

## Contribution Guidelines

Pages should preferably be rendered on the server side with Jinja. Features should work with noscript if feasible.
Design changes have to fit the overall design.

Introduction of JS dependencies should first be discussed on Discord or in a draft PR.

See also [docs/style.md](/docs/style.md) for the style guide.
