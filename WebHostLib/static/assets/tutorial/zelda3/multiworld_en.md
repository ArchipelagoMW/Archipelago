## Required Software
- [Archipelago](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases)
- [SNI](https://github.com/alttpo/sni/releases) (Included in Archipelago)
- Hardware or software capable of loading and playing SNES ROM files
    - An emulator capable of connecting to SNI
      ([snes9x Multitroid](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_ej-pwWtCAHYXIrvs5Hro16A1s9Hi3Jz),
      [BizHawk](http://tasvideos.org/BizHawk.html))
    - An SD2SNES, [FXPak Pro](https://krikzz.com/store/home/54-fxpak-pro.html), or other compatible hardware
- Your Japanese v1.0 ROM file, probably named `Zelda no Densetsu - Kamigami no Triforce (Japan).sfc`

## Installation Procedures

### Windows Setup
1. Download and install Archipelago from the link above, making sure to install the most recent version.
**The file is located in the assets section at the bottom of the version information**. If you intend to play normal
multiworld games, you want `Setup.Archipelago.exe`
    - During the installation process, you will be asked to browse for your Japanese 1.0 ROM file. If you have
      installed this software before and are simply upgrading now, you will not be prompted to locate your
      ROM file a second time.
    - You may also be prompted to install Microsoft Visual C++. If you already have this software on your computer
      (possibly because a Steam game installed it already), the installer will not prompt you to install it again.

2. If you are using an emulator, you should assign your Lua capable emulator as your default program
for launching ROM files.
    1. Extract your emulator's folder to your Desktop, or somewhere you will remember. 
    2. Right click on a ROM file and select **Open with...**
    3. Check the box next to **Always use this app to open .sfc files**
    4. Scroll to the bottom of the list and click the grey text **Look for another App on this PC**
    5. Browse for your emulator's `.exe` file and click **Open**. This file should be located inside
       the folder you extracted in step one.

### Macintosh Setup
- We need volunteers to help fill this section! Please contact **Farrak Kilhn** on Discord if you want to help.

## Configuring your YAML file

### What is a YAML file and why do I need one?
Your YAML file contains a set of configuration options which provide the generator with information about how
it should generate your game. Each player of a multiworld will provide their own YAML file. This setup allows
each player to enjoy an experience customized for their taste, and different players in the same multiworld
can all have different options.

### Where do I get a YAML file?
The [Generate Game](/games/A Link to the Past/player-settings) page on the website allows you to configure your personal settings and
export a YAML file from them.

### Verifying your YAML file
If you would like to validate your YAML file to make sure it works, you may do so on the
[YAML Validator](/mysterycheck) page.

## Generating a Single-Player Game
1. Navigate to the [Player Settings](/games/A%20Link%20to%20the%20Past/player-settings) page, configure your options, and click the "Generate Game" button.
2. You will be presented with a "Seed Info" page, where you can download your patch file.
3. Double-click on your patch file, and the emulator should launch with your game automatically. As the
   Client is unnecessary for single player games, you may close it and the WebUI.

## Joining a MultiWorld Game

### Obtain your patch file and create your ROM
When you join a multiworld game, you will be asked to provide your YAML file to whoever is hosting. Once that
is done, the host will provide you with either a link to download your patch file, or with a zip file containing
everyone's patch files. Your patch file should have a `.apbp` extension.

Put your patch file on your desktop or somewhere convenient, and double click it. This should automatically
launch the client, and will also create your ROM file in the same place as your patch file.

### Connect to the client

#### With an emulator
When the client launched automatically, SNI should have also automatically launched in the background.
If this is its first time launching, you may be prompted to allow it to communicate through the Windows
Firewall.

##### snes9x Multitroid
1. Load your ROM file if it hasn't already been loaded.
2. Click on the File menu and hover on **Lua Scripting**
3. Click on **New Lua Script Window...**
4. In the new window, click **Browse...**
5. Browse to the location you extracted snes9x Multitroid to, enter the `lua` folder, and choose `multibridge.lua`
6. Observe a name has been assigned to you, and that the client shows "SNES Device: Connected", with that same
   name in the upper left corner.

##### BizHawk
1. Ensure you have the BSNES core loaded. You may do this by clicking on the Tools menu in BizHawk and following
   these menu options:
   `Config --> Cores --> SNES --> BSNES`  
   Once you have changed the loaded core, you must restart BizHawk.
2. Load your ROM file if it hasn't already been loaded.
3. Click on the Tools menu and click on **Lua Console**
4. Click the button to open a new Lua script.
5. Browse to your MultiWorld Utilities installation directory, and into the following directories:  
   `SNI`
6. Select `Connector.lua` and click Open.
7. Observe a name has been assigned to you, and that the client shows "SNES Device: Connected", with that same
   name in the upper left corner. 

#### With hardware
This guide assumes you have downloaded the correct firmware for your device. If you have not
done so already, please do this now. SD2SNES and FXPak Pro users may download the appropriate firmware
[here](https://github.com/RedGuyyyy/sd2snes/releases). Other hardware may find helpful information
[on this page](http://usb2snes.com/#supported-platforms).

1. Close your emulator, which may have auto-launched.
2. Power on your device and load the ROM.
3. Observe the client window now shows "SNES Device: Connected", and lists the name of your device.

### Connect to the MultiServer
The patch file which launched your client should have automatically connected you to the MultiServer.
There are a few reasons this may not happen however, including if the game is hosted on the website but
was generated elsewhere. If the client window shows "Server Status: Not Connected", simply ask the host
for the address of the server, and copy/paste it into the "Server" input field then press enter.

The client will attempt to reconnect to the new server address, and should momentarily show "Server
Status: Connected". If the client does not connect after a few moments, you may need to refresh the page.

### Play the game
When the client shows both SNES Device and Server as connected, you're ready to begin playing. Congratulations
on successfully joining a multiworld game!

## Hosting a MultiWorld game
The recommended way to host a game is to use the hosting service provided on
[the website](/generate). The process is relatively simple:

1. Collect YAML files from your players.
2. Create a zip file containing your players' YAML files.
3. Upload that zip file to the website linked above.
4. Wait a moment while the seed is generated.
5. When the seed is generated, you will be redirected to a "Seed Info" page.
6. Click "Create New Room". This will take you to the server page. Provide the link to this page to your players,
   so they may download their patch files from there.  
   **Note:** The patch files provided on this page will allow players to automatically connect to the server,
   while the patch files on the "Seed Info" page will not.
7. Note that a link to a MultiWorld Tracker is at the top of the room page. You should also provide this link
   to your players, so they can watch the progress of the game. Any observers may also be given the link to
   this page.
8. Once all players have joined, you may begin playing.

## Auto-Tracking
If you would like to use auto-tracking for your game, several pieces of software provide this functionality.  
The recommended software for auto-tracking is currently
[OpenTracker](https://github.com/trippsc2/OpenTracker/releases).

### Installation
1. Download the appropriate installation file for your computer (Windows users want the `.msi` file).
2. During the installation process, you may be asked to install the Microsoft Visual Studio Build Tools. A link
   to this software is provided during the installation procedure, and it must be installed manually.
   
### Enable auto-tracking
1. With OpenTracker launched, click the Tracking menu at the top of the window, then choose **AutoTracker...**
2. Click the **Get Devices** button
3. Select your SNES device from the drop-down list
4. If you would like to track small keys and dungeon items, check the box labeled **Race Illegal Tracking**
5. Click the **Start Autotracking** button
6. Close the AutoTracker window, as it is no longer necessary
