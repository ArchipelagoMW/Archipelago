    - This will create the appropriate directories for you to place the file in the following step.

3. Place the `aprandomizer-x.x.x.jar` from the link above file into the `mods` folder of the above installation of your forge server.

## Configuring your YAML file

### What is a YAML file and why do I need one?
Your YAML file contains a set of configuration options which provide the generator with information about how
it should generate your game. Each player of a multiworld will provide their own YAML file. This setup allows
each player to enjoy an experience customized for their taste, and different players in the same multiworld
can all have different options.

### Where do I get a YAML file?
A basic minecraft yaml will look like this.
```yaml
description: Template Name # Used to describe your yaml. Useful if you have multiple files
name: YourName # Your name in-game. Spaces will be replaced with underscores and there is a 16 character limit
#{player} will be replaced with the player's slot number.
#{PLAYER} will be replaced with the player's slot number if that slot number is greater than 1.
#{number} will be replaced with the counter value of the name.
#{NUMBER} will be replaced with the counter value of the name if the counter value is greater than 1.

## Joining a MultiWorld Game

### Obtain your Minecraft data file
**Only one yaml file needs to be submitted per minecraft world regardless of how many players play on it.**

When you join a multiworld game, you will be asked to provide your YAML file to whoever is hosting. Once that
is done, the host will provide you with either a link to download your data file, or with a zip file containing
everyone's data files. Your data file should have a `.apmc` extension.

Put your data file in your forge server `APData` folder. Make sure to remove any previous data file that was in
there all ready

### Connect to the MultiServer
After having placed your data file in the `APData` folder, start the Forge server and make sure you have OP
status by typing `/op YourMinecraftUsername` in the forge server console then connecting in your Minecraft client.

Once in game type `/connect <AP-Address> <Name> (<Password>)` where `<AP-Address>` is the address of the
Archipelago server and `<Name>` is the case-sensitive name that was in your YAML file. `(<Password>)`
is only required if the Archipleago server you are using has a password set.

### Play the game
When the console tells you that you have joined the room, you're ready to begin playing. Congratulations
on successfully joining a multiworld game! At this point any additional minecraft players may connect to your
forge server.
