## Configuring your YAML file

### What is a YAML file and why do I need one?

Your YAML file contains a set of configuration options which provide the generator with information about how it should
generate your game. Each player of a multiworld will provide their own YAML file. This setup allows each player to enjoy
an experience customized for their taste, and different players in the same multiworld can all have different options.

### Where do I get a YAML file?

you can customize your settings by visiting
the [Slay the Spire Settings Page](/games/Slay%20the%20Spire/player-settings).

### Connect to the MultiServer

For Steam-based installations, if you are subscribed to ModTheSpire, when you launch the game, you should have the
option to launch the game with mods. On the mod loader screen, ensure you only have the following mods enabled and then
start the game:

- BaseMod
- Archipelago Multiworld Randomizer

Once you are in-game, you will be able to click the **Archipelago** menu option and enter the ip and port (separated by
a colon) in the hostname field and enter your player slot name in the Slot Name field. Then click connect, and now you
are ready to climb the spire!
