# Timespinner Randomizer Setup Guide

## Required Software

- [Timespinner (steam)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/368620/Timespinner/), [Timespinner (humble)](https://www.humblebundle.com/store/timespinner) or [Timespinner (GOG)](https://www.gog.com/game/timespinner) (other versions are not supported)
- [Timespinner Randomizer](https://github.com/JarnoWesthof/TsRandomizer)

## General Concept

The timespinner Randomizer loads Timespinner.exe from the same folder, and alters its state in memory to allow for randomization of the items

## Installation Procedures

Download latest release on [Timespinner Randomizer Releases](https://github.com/JarnoWesthof/TsRandomizer/releases) you can find the .zip files on the releases page, download the zip for your current platform. Then extract the zip to the folder where your Timespinner game is installed. Then just run TsRandomizer.exe (on windows) or TsRandomizerItemTracker.bin.x86_64 (on linux) or TsRandomizerItemTracker.bin.osx (on mac) instead of Timespinner.exe to start the game in randomized mode, for more info see the [ReadMe](https://github.com/JarnoWesthof/TsRandomizer)
