# The Witness Randomizer Setup

## Required Software

- [The Witness (Steam)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/210970/The_Witness/)
- [The Witness Archipalego Randomizer](https://github.com/JarnoWesthof/The-Witness-Randomizer-for-Archipelago)
- [Archipelago Common Client](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases)

## Joining a MultiWorld Game

This Randomizer can be very "moody" if you don't do everything in the correct order.
It is recommended to do every single one of these steps when you connect to a world.

1. Launch The Witness
2. Start a fresh save (unless you have absolutely no other choice)
3. Do not move
4. Launch [The Witness Archipalego Randomizer](https://store.steampowered.com/app/210970/The_Witness/)
5. Enter the Archipelago Adress, Slot Name and Password
6. Press "Randomize"
7. Wait for the randomization to fully finish before moving in-game

That's it! Have fun!

## Common Client

Its recommended to have Archipelago's Common Client open on the side to keep track of what item you receive and send as The Witness has no in-game messages.
