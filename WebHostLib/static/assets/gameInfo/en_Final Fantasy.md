# Final Fantasy 1 (NES)

## Where is the settings page?
Unlike most games on Archipelago.gg, Final Fantasy 1's settings are controlled entirely by the original randomzier.
You can find an exhaustive list of documented settings [here](https://finalfantasyrandomizer.com/)

## What does randomization do to this game?
A better questions is what isn't randomized at this point. Enemies stats and spell, character spells, shop inventory
and boss stats and spells are all commonly randomized. Unlike most other randomizers it is also most standard to shuffle
progression items and non-progression items into separate pools and then redistribute them to their respective 
locations. So ,for example, Princess Sarah may have the CANOE instead of the LUTE; however, she will never have a Heal 
Pot or some armor. There are plenty of other things that can be randomized on our 
[main randomizer site](https://finalfantasyrandomizer.com/)

Some features are not currently supported by AP. A non-exhaustive list includes:
- Entrance/Floor Shuffle (Coming Soon!)
- The shop item is removed entirely
- Shard Hunt
- Experience Chests
- Proc Gen Overworld
- Deep Dungeon

## What Final Fantasy items can appear in other players' worlds?
Currently, only progression items can appear in other players' worlds. Armor, Weapons and Consumable Items can not.

## What does another world's item look like in Final Fantasy
All local and remote items appear the same. It will say that you received an item and then BOTH the client log and
the emulator will display what was found external to the in-game text box.
