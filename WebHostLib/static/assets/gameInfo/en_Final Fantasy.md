# Final Fantasy 1 (NES)

## Where is the settings page?

Unlike most games on Archipelago.gg, Final Fantasy 1's settings are controlled entirely by the original randomzier. You
can find an exhaustive list of documented settings on the FFR
website: [FF1R Website](https://finalfantasyrandomizer.com/)

## What does randomization do to this game?

A better questions is what isn't randomized at this point. Enemies stats and spell, character spells, shop inventory and
boss stats and spells are all commonly randomized. Unlike most other randomizers it is also most standard to shuffle
progression items and non-progression items into separate pools and then redistribute them to their respective
locations. So, for example, Princess Sarah may have the CANOE instead of the LUTE; however, she will never have a Heal
Pot or some armor. There are plenty of other things that can be randomized on the main randomizer
site: [FF1R Website](https://finalfantasyrandomizer.com/)

## What Final Fantasy items can appear in other players' worlds?

All items can appear in other players worlds. This includes consumables, shards, weapons, armor and, of course, key
items.

## What does another world's item look like in Final Fantasy

All local and remote items appear the same. It will say that you received an item and then BOTH the client log and the
emulator will display what was found external to the in-game text box.
