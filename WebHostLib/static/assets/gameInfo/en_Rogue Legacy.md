# Rogue Legacy (PC)

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) is located contains all the options you need to configure
and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

You are not able to buy skill upgrades in the manor upgrade screen, and instead, need to find them in order to level up
your character to make fighting the 5 bosses easier.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

All the skill upgrades, class upgrades, runes packs, and equipment packs are shuffled in the manor upgrade screen, diary
checks, chests and fairy chests, and boss rewards. Skill upgrades are also grouped in packs of 5 to make the finding of
stats less of a chore. Runes and Equipment are also grouped together.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any of the items which can be shuffled may also be placed into another player's world. It is possible to choose to limit
certain items to your own world.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

When the player receives an item, your character will hold the item above their head and display it to the world. It's
good for business!
