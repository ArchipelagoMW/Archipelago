# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is a randomizer?

A randomizer is a modification of a video game which reorganizes the items required to progress through the game. A
normal play-through of a game might require you to use item A to unlock item B, then C, and so forth. In a randomized
game, you might first find item C, then A, then B.

This transforms games from a linear experience into a puzzle, presenting players with a new challenge each time they
play a randomized game. Putting items in non-standard locations can require the player to think about the game world and
the items they encounter in new and interesting ways.

## What happens if an item is placed somewhere it is impossible to get?

The randomizer has many strict sets of rules it must follow when generating a game. One of the functions of these rules
is to ensure items necessary to complete the game will be accessible to the player. Many games also have a subset of
rules allowing certain items to be placed in normally unreachable locations, provided the player has indicated they are
comfortable exploiting certain glitches in the game.

## What is a multi-world?

While a randomizer shuffles a game, a multi-world randomizer shuffles that game for multiple players. For example, in a
two player multi-world, players A and B each get their own randomized version of a game, called a world. In each player's
game, they may find items which belong to the other player. If player A finds an item which belongs to player B, the
item will be sent to player B's world over the internet.

This creates a cooperative experience during multi-world games, requiring players to rely upon each other to complete
their game.

## What happens if a person has to leave early?

If a player must leave early, they can use Archipelago's release system. When a player releases their game, all the
items in that game which belong to other players are sent out automatically, so other players can continue to play.

## What does multi-game mean?

While a multi-world game traditionally requires all players to be playing the same game, a multi-game multi-world allows
players to randomize any of a number of supported games, and send items between them. This allows players of different
games to interact with one another in a single multiplayer environment.

## Can I generate a single-player game with Archipelago?

Yes. All our supported games can be generated as single-player experiences, and so long as you download the software,
the website is not required to generate them.

## How do I get started?

If you are ready to start randomizing games, or want to start playing your favorite randomizer with others, please join
our discord server at the [Archipelago Discord](https://discord.gg/8Z65BR2). There are always people ready to answer
any questions you might have.

## What are some common terms I should know?

As randomizers and multiworld randomizers have been around for a while now there are quite a lot of common terms
and jargon that is used in conjunction by the communities surrounding them. For a lot of the terms that are more common
to Archipelago and its specific systems please see the [Glossary](/glossary/en).

## I want to add a game to the Archipelago randomizer. How do I do that?

The best way to get started is to take a look at our code on GitHub
at [Archipelago GitHub Page](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago).

There you will find examples of games in the worlds folder
at [/worlds Folder in Archipelago Code](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/tree/main/worlds).

You may also find developer documentation in the docs folder
at [/docs Folder in Archipelago Code](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/tree/main/docs).
