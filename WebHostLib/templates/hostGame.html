                This page allows you to host a game which was not generated by the website. For example, if you have
                generated a game on your own computer, you may upload the zip file created by the generator to
                host the game here. This will also provide a tracker, and the ability for your players to download
                their patch files.
            </p>
            <p>In addition to the zip file created by the generator, you may upload a multidata file here as well.</p>
