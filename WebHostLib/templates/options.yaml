# What is this file?
# This file contains options which allow you to configure your multiworld experience while allowing others
# to play how they want as well.

# How do I use it?
# The options in this file are weighted. This means the higher number you assign to a value, the more
# chances you have for that option to be chosen. For example, an option like this:
#
# map_shuffle:
#   on: 5
#   off: 15
#
# Means you have 5 chances for map shuffle to occur, and 15 chances for map shuffle to be turned off

# I've never seen a file like this before. What characters am I allowed to use?
# This is a .yaml file. You are allowed to use most characters.
# To test if your yaml is valid or not, you can use this website:
# http://www.yamllint.com/

description: Default {{ game }} Template # Used to describe your yaml. Useful if you have multiple files
name: YourName{number} # Your name in-game. Spaces will be replaced with underscores and there is a 16 character limit
#{player} will be replaced with the player's slot number.
#{PLAYER} will be replaced with the player's slot number if that slot number is greater than 1.
#{number} will be replaced with the counter value of the name.
#{NUMBER} will be replaced with the counter value of the name if the counter value is greater than 1.

# Shared Options supported by all games:
accessibility:
  items: 0 # Guarantees you will be able to acquire all items, but you may not be able to access all locations
  locations: 50 # Guarantees you will be able to access all locations, and therefore all items
  none: 0 # Guarantees only that the game is beatable. You may not be able to access all locations or acquire all items
progression_balancing:
  on: 50 # A system to reduce BK, as in times during which you can't do anything by moving your items into an earlier access sphere to make it likely you have stuff to do
  off: 0 # Turn this off if you don't mind a longer multiworld, or can glitch/sequence break around missing items.
  # The following 4 options can be uncommented and moved into a game's section they should affect
