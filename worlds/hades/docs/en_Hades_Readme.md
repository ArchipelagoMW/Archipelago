# Hades (PC)


## What does randomization do to this game?

It gives the option to randomize Keepsakes, Weapons, Weapons hidden aspects, filler items packs, important items from the 
contractor store and "pact levels" into the item pool. Pact levels are forced heat pact from the heat menu, that 
won't be decreased until the pact level item is received.

Location consists of items from the contractor, keepsake locations, finishing fates from the fated list
and finishing rooms in 3 different modes. One is location-based, in which finishing each room gives an AP item.
Another one is score-based, in which each room gives a score, and enough score gives an AP item. The last one
is location based on the equipped weapon, in which finishing each room with new weapons gives an AP item. 

## What is the goal of the game?

The goal can be adjusted. You can adjust how many times you need to beat Hades, with how many different weapons,
with how many fates were completed and how many keepsakes were unlocked.

## Do I need to start from a fresh file or a completed one?

The randomizer is intended to be used on a fresh file. Using it on a completed one may cause unforeseen issues.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any of the items which can be shuffled may also be placed into another player's world. 

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

When someone sends you an item, you will see on screen a message telling what item you got and how it changes the game.
If you receive a pact of punishment item you will see the heat level going down, if it is a filler item, how much you get
and so on.

## What settings can I change in the .yaml?

You can choose how many pacts of punishments start on when you play the game, how many of each item you get when receiving 
filler item, if Keepsakes, Weapons, and Weapon hidden aspects are shuffled into the pool (along with their location). 
You can also choose how rooms give new items (with the 3 different modes described at the start).
