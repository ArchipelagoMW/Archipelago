# ChecksFinder Randomizer Setup Guide

## Required Software

- ChecksFinder from
  the [Github releases Page for the game](https://github.com/jonloveslegos/ChecksFinder/releases) (latest version)
- Archipelago from the [Archipelago Releases Page](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases)
    - (select `ChecksFinder Client` during installation.)

## Configuring your YAML file

### What is a YAML file and why do I need one?

See the guide on setting up a basic YAML at the Archipelago setup
guide: [Basic Multiworld Setup Guide](/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en)

### Where do I get a YAML file?

You can customize your settings by visiting the [ChecksFinder Player Settings Page](/games/ChecksFinder/player-settings)

### Generating a ChecksFinder game

**ChecksFinder is meant to be played _alongside_ another game! You may not be playing it for long periods of time if 
you play it by itself with another person!**

When you join a multiworld game, you will be asked to provide your YAML file to whoever is hosting. Once that is done,
the host will provide you with either a link to download your data file, or with a zip file containing everyone's data
files. You do not have a file inside that zip though!

You need to start ChecksFinder client yourself, it is located within the Archipelago folder.

### Connect to the MultiServer

First start ChecksFinder.

Once both ChecksFinder and the client are started. In the client at the top type in the spot labeled `Server` type the 
`Ip Address` and `Port` separated with a `:` symbol.

The client will then ask for the username you chose, input that in the text box at the bottom of the client.

### Play the game

When the console tells you that you have joined the room, you're all set. Congratulations on successfully joining a
multiworld game!
