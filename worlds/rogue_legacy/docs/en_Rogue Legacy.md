# Rogue Legacy (PC)

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains most of the options you need to 
configure and export a config file. Some options can only be made in YAML, but an explanation can be found in the
[template yaml here](../../../static/generated/configs/Rogue%20Legacy.yaml).

## What does randomization do to this game?

Rogue Legacy Randomizer takes all the classes, skills, runes, and blueprints and spreads them out into chests, the manor
upgrade screen, bosses, and some special individual locations. The goal is to become powerful enough to defeat the four
zone bosses and then defeat The Fountain.

## What items and locations get shuffled?
All the skill upgrades, class upgrades, runes packs, and equipment packs are shuffled in the manor upgrade screen, diary
checks, chests and fairy chests, and boss rewards. Skill upgrades are also grouped in packs of 5 to make the finding of
stats less of a chore. Runes and Equipment are also grouped together.

Some additional locations that can contain items are the Jukebox, the Portraits, and the mini-game rewards.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any of the items which can be shuffled may also be placed into another player's world. It is possible to choose to limit
certain items to your own world.
## When the player receives an item, what happens?

When the player receives an item, your character will hold the item above their head and display it to the world. It's
good for business!
