# Rogue Legacy Randomizer

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for Rogue Legacy Randomizer](../player-settings) contains most of the options you need to 
configure and export a config file. You can also visit the [weighted settings page](/weighted-settings) for the 
remaining advanced options for Rogue Legacy, or download a 
[template config file here](/static/generated/configs/Rogue%20Legacy.yaml).

## What does randomization mean for Rogue Legacy?

Rogue Legacy Randomizer takes all the classes, skills, runes, blueprints, and other miscellaneous items and places them
in random chests, the manor, and other special locations. The goal is to become powerful enough to defeat The Fountain.

## What items and locations can I find?

The following "things" are potential items you could find:

* Every class upgrade.
* Every skill upgrade (in groups of 5).
* Every blueprint.
* Every rune.
* Free shrines that give a specific relic.
* Various stat-increases and gold.
* The slots for the Blacksmith and Enchantress (if shuffled).
* The Architect (if shuffled).
* Per life spending increases (if enabled).
* Pieces of the Fountain to unlock the final boss room (if enabled).
* Various unhelpful traps (if enabled).

You'll potentially find all of these (and other world items) in the following locations:

* The Manor upgrades screen.
* In chests in each zone (or any chest if **Universal Chests** are enabled).
* In fairy chests in each zone (or any fairy chest if **Universal Fairy Chests** are enabled).
* Inside the chests for each boss.
* Inside the chests for each mini-boss.
* As a reward from the Carnival mini-game and Cheapskate Elf mini-game.
* Inside the chests in the secret room.
* Beside the Jukebox.
* Underneath the portrait of a previous Cellar Door Games project.
* By reading one of the 25 diary entries.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

You'll get an alert on the sidebar showing all the recent items that you have received. You can also pause and option
your character card to see all items received.

## What are Fountain pieces?

As an alternative objective to beating the 4 main bosses, you can turn Rogue Legacy into a collect-a-thon where you need
to find enough "fountain pieces" to open the door. You can also combine it with the normal goal if you still want to be
required to defeat each boss.
