# id1Common

This is the id1Common library, an abstract base world class for games running on Archipelago Doom 2.0. This library contains the hand-written common code between all of these worlds to make them all function.

The individual code for id1Common worlds (e.g. DOOM 1993, DOOM II, Heretic) is largely automatically generated by the tool `ap_gen_tool`. For more information, see [ArchipelagoDoom/ap_gen_tool](https://github.com/ArchipelagoDoom/ap_gen_tool).
