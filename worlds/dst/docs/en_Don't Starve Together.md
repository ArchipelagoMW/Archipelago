# Don't Starve Together

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Instead of learning recipes from a prototyping station, your recipes are earned by doing tasks in Don't Starve Together,
or when another player in your multiworld finds one of your items.

The generator will ensure progression logic to be able to reach your goal, which you have 3 difficulties to choose from:
- Easy: Ensure items useful for your survival such as weapons, armor, lighting, seasonal gear, and base structures.
- Advanced: Expects you to know the game well and to survive seasons under-equipped.
- Expert: Expects you to be a pro and survive in riskier conditions, such as entering the ruins without light, etc.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

New recipes will appear in your crafting menu, and will appear as prototypable if you have the materials, without the need 
to be near a crafting station.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Most recipes that would normally be learned at a Science Machine, Alchemy Engine, Prestithatitor, Shadow Manipulator, and
Think Tank, and rare blueprints have been shuffled into the item pool, along with various boss loot. Traps may be included
if you choose to enable them. Optionally, you can also shuffle your basic starting items or items normally only craftable
at the Ancient Pseudoscience Station or Celestial Altar.

However, not included in the item pool are:
- Character-specific recipes
- Cosmetic and decorative items
- Fishing lures learnable at the Tackle Receptacle. (The Tackle Receptacle itself is shuffled)
- Turfs learnable at the Terra Firma Tamper. (The Terra Firma Tamper itself is shuffled)
- Post-Ancient-Fuelweaver and post-Celestial-Champion content. These items will be included when the game's new content arcs are more developed.

Anything not shuffled will be craftable at their respective crafting station as in vanilla Don't Starve Together.

## What does another world's item look like in Don't Starve Together?

When near a crafting station, you will see "Interdimensional Research" items with the Archipelago icon, along with information
what the item is and its recipient. However 95% of the the time a trap item will have a randomly generated name, so keep an eye
out for fakes!

Items can also appear as blueprint, called "Interdimensional Blueprint", which can then be activated to award your check.

In most other cases you won't see the physical item in-game but you will receive a chat notification when you find an item.

## What is the goal of Don't Starve Together?

The player is able to choose their victory condition in their config file:
- Survival: The player must live for a target number of days. This is based on the survivor's time alive and not the world age.
Being a ghost will not progress your timer.
- Bosses: The player can choose which bosses they need to defeat in order to meet their victory condition. You can choose
between defeating any one of your selected bosses, or all of them. Boss and location checks that happen to be part of your progression 
path will be prioritized for having progression items.

## What are location checks in Don't Starve Together?

Location checks in Don't Starve Together include:
- Creatures (Optional): Either killing or non-violently interacting with creatures (such as capturing or trading with).
- Bosses: Defeating a boss. You can choose whether or not harder bosses can have important progression items in your config.
- Crock Pot Dishes (Optional): Cooking a meal in the Crock Pot. You can customize whether or not Warly's exclusive dishes count,
or whether to only count meat or veggie meals.
- Farming Giant Crops (Optional): Growing and harvesting a giant farm plant.
- Crafting Stations: Crafting stations themselves are not shuffled, but have Archipelago items that you can craft.
- Crabby Hermit: Progressing through Crabby Hermit's quests unlocks Archipelago items you can exchange for empty bottles.
- Various Milestones: Such as finding Pig King, Chester, Hutch, or places you would find rare blueprints.

## What world settings should be used when generating your world in Don't Starve Together?

Currently the randomizer is designed to work for worlds with caves.

## Is this compatible with other Don't Starve Together mods?

This should be compatible with other Don't Starve Together mods. Modded items will not be shuffled and will be craftable as normal.

## Can this be played in multiplayer?

Yes, other players can join your world. Everyone will work together in the same Archipelago slot. Each player can get
location checks, and each player will receive Archipelago items. If you chose the survival goal type, only the longest-living
survivor will count for the victory condition.
