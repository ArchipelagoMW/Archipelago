## Hint Games

HintGames do not need to be added at the start of a seed, and do not create a 'slot'- instead, you connect the HintGame client to a different game's slot. By playing a HintGame, you can earn hints for the connected slot.

## What is this game?

Play Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulties, earning a hint for each puzzle correctly solved. Harder puzzles are more likely to grant a hint towards a Progression item, though otherwise what hint is granted is random.

## Where is the options page?

There is no options page; this game cannot be used in your .yamls. Instead, the client can connect to any slot in a multiworld.
