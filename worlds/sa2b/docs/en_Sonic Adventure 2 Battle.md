# Sonic Adventure 2: Battle

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

The randomizer shuffles emblems and upgrade items into the AP item pool. The story mode is disabled, but stage select is available from the start. Levels can be locked behind gates requiring a certain number of emblems and a boss fight to unlock. Cannon's Core will be locked behind a percentage of all available emblems, and completing Cannon's Core will unlock the Biolizard boss if Biolizard is the goal. If the emerald hunt goal is selected, collecting all seven Chaos Emeralds will unlock Green Hill Zone. Progress towards unlocking Cannon's Core and the next stage gate will be displayed on the Stage Select screen.

## What is the goal of Sonic Adventure 2: Battle when randomized?

If the Biolizard goal is selected, the objective is to unlock and complete the required number of Cannon's Core Missions, then complete the Biolizard boss fight. If the Emerald Hunt goal is selected, the objective is to find the seven Chaos Emeralds then complete Green Hill Zone and optionally default Final Hazard.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

All 30 story stages leading up to Cannon's Core will be shuffled and can be optionally placed behind emblem requirement gates. Mission order can be shuffled for each stage. Chao keys, animal pipes, hidden whistle spots, and gold beetles can be added as additional locations to check in each stage. Chao Garden emblems can optionally be added to the randomizer. All emblems from the selected mission range and all 28 character upgrade items get shuffled. At most 180 emblems will be added to the item pool, after which remaining items added will be random collectables (rings, shields, etc). Traps can also be optionally included.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any shuffled item can be in other players' worlds.

## What does another world's item look like in Sonic Adventure 2: Battle

Emblems have no visualization in the randomizer and items all retain their original appearance. Chao Keys will appear as an Archipelago logo even if the keysanity option is disabled. Despite the appearance, they will only count as a check if the keysanity option is enabled. You won't know if an item belongs to another player until you collect.

## When the player receives an emblem or item, what happens?

When the player collects an emblem or item, text will appear on screen to indicate who the item was for and what the item was. When collecting an upgrade location, the orignal item collection text will display and will likely not be correct.
