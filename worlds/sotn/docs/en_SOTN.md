# Symphony of the Night

## Where is the settings page?
Add later

## What does randomization do to this game?
Shuffle all items and relics in the item pool.

## What is the goal of Symphony of the Night when randomized?
Kill Darth Vader. No, kill your father Dracula, so gather all relics of Vlad and join him on Reverse Center Cube.
(TODO: Maybe add castle exploration as a possible extra goal or ending need it, normal or reverse)

## Which items can be in another player's world?
Everything. Items, relics, vessels(life and heart). (TODO: Add some traps?)

## What is considered a location check in SOTN?
Every item, including the ones behind breakable scenery and relics, some will have a heart but some will have
nothing so it's best for you to know the position of relics. Getting closer to it will grant you a check. 

## What does another world's item look like in SOTN?
Your items can be your own or a blue bag of gold. Items from other worlds will be a orange bag of gold.
(TODO: Make some variations for other world items, progressive and filler items)

## When the player receives an item, what happens?
A message is shown in the client log and on client screen of the emulator at top-left. Your items appear
magically in your inventory. (TODO: Add some way to item be looted instead of magic)  

## What are recommended settings to tweak for beginners to the rando?
You can choose a preset easy difficult to have a greater chance on progression items and access to more powerful
equipment.

## Help! I'm softlocked?
You probably need an item from another world or doing a trick is expected to be known.

## How do I get into the hidden area at Castle Entrance
You need both Soul of wolf and bat. In the room with some water on the lower part, before you meet Death, there is a big
rock that can be broken on both sides from left to right go through the rock as wolf than come back as a bat, a door
will open on the lower left side. REMEMBER that Jewel Sword will be missing if you didn't visit Alchemy Laboratory yet.

## Can I access the left room on Outer Wall without Form of the mist
Yes. On the upper room there is a breakable wall on the left side, break it and stay still inside for like 20 seconds,
a pinkish elevator will bring you down. That does NOT apply to Reverse Outer Wall.

## A location is too high. I can't reach it
Remember you can chain gravity jumps with Leap Stone or Soul of wolf or Form of mist

## I broke a wall and couldn't get the drop before it vanish
Progression items are banished from de-spawn spots if it was for another player don't fret he will get it, if it
was for you, sorry but you lost it sorry.
