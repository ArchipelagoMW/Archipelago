# Symphony of the Night

## Where is the settings page?
Add later

## What does randomization do to this game?
Shuffle all items and replace all Relics with a Sword Card. (TODO: Will see if relics could only have your own relic
or a sword card, relics don´t see the have a check flag so no foreign items are possible here) 

## What is the goal of Symphony of the Night when randomized?
Kill Darth Vader. No, kill your father Dracula, so gather all relics of Vlad and join him on Reverse Center Cube.
(TODO: Maybe add castle exploration as a possible extra goal or ending need it, normal or reverse)

## Which items can be in another player's world?
Everything. Items, relics, vessels(life and heart). (TODO: Add some traps?)

## What is considered a location check in SOTN?
Every item, including the ones behind breakable scenery,bump librarian(maybe should be removed, couldnt find the address
of the item) and every boss kill

## What does another world's item look like in SOTN?
Every item will be some bag of gold. (TODO: Make some variations for other world items, progressive and filler items.
Need to optimize ecc/edc calculation to be feasible) 

## When the player receives an item, what happens?
A message is shown in the client log. A message appear on client screen of the emulator.(same as in adventure,
TODO: maybe write another one in the future).
Your items appears magically in your inventory. (TODO: Add some way to item be looted instead of magic)  

## What are recommended settings to tweak for beginners to the rando?
Didn´t think much(except for opening zones back doors) or implement a settings page so nothing to read here. 

## Help! I'm softlocked?
You probably need an item from another world or doing a trick is expected to be known. (TODO: Make some info on the
tricks)

## How do I get into the hidden area at Castle Entrance
You need both Soul of wolf and bat. In the room with some water on the lower part, before you meet Death, there is a big
rock that can be broken on both sides from left to right go through the rock as wolf than come back as a bat, a door
will open on the lower left side. REMEMBER that Jewel Sword will be missing if you didn't visit Alchemy Laboratory yet.

## Can I access the left room on Outer Wall without Form of the mist
Yes. On the upper room there is a breakable wall on the left side, break it and stay still inside for like 20 seconds,
a pinkish elevator will bring you down. That does NOT apply to Reverse Outer Wall.

## A location is too high. I can't reach it
Remember you can chain gravity jumps with Leap Stone or Soul of wolf or Form of mist

## I broke a wall and couldn't get the drop before it vanish
If it was a progression for anyone the check was just breaking the wall if was just a local equipable you lost it. Sorry
