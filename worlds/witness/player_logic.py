"""
Parses the WitnessLogic.txt logic file into useful data structures.
This is the heart of the randomization.

In WitnessLogic.txt we have regions defined with their connections:

Region Name (Short name) - Connected Region 1 - Connection Requirement 1 - Connected Region 2...

And then panels in that region with the hex code used in the game
previous panels that are required to turn them on, as well as the symbols they require:

0x##### (Panel Name) - Required Panels - Required Items

On __init__, the base logic is read and all panels are given Location IDs.
When the world has parsed its options, a second function is called to finalize the logic.
