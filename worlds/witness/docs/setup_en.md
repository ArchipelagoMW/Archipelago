To continue an earlier game:

2. Load the save you last played this world on, if it's not the one you loaded into automatically
3. Launch [The Witness Archipelago Randomizer](https://github.com/NewSoupVi/The-Witness-Randomizer-for-Archipelago)
4. Press "Load Credentials" (or type them in manually)
5. Press "Connect"

## Archipelago Text Client

It is recommended to have Archipelago's Text Client open on the side to keep track of what items you receive and send, as The Witness has no in-game messages.
<br/>Or use the Auto-Tracker!

## Auto-Tracking

The Witness has a fully functional map tracker that supports auto-tracking.

1. Download [The Witness Map- and Auto-Tracker](https://github.com/NewSoupVi/witness_archipelago_tracker/releases) and [PopTracker](https://github.com/black-sliver/PopTracker/releases).
2. Open PopTracker, and load the Witness pack. 
3. Click on the "AP" symbol at the top.
4. Enter the AP address, slot name and password. 

The rest should take care of itself! Items and checks will be marked automatically, and it even knows your settings - It will hide checks & adjust logic accordingly. Note that the tracker may be out of date.
