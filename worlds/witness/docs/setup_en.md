## Archipelago Text Client

It is recommended to have Archipelago's Text Client open on the side to keep track of what items you receive and send.
<br/>The Witness does display received and sent items in-game, but only for a short time, and the messages are easy to miss while playing.

<br/><br/>Of course, you can also use the Auto-Tracker!

## Auto-Tracking

The Witness has a fully functional map tracker that supports auto-tracking.

1. Download [The Witness Map- and Auto-Tracker](https://github.com/NewSoupVi/witness_archipelago_tracker/releases) and [PopTracker](https://github.com/black-sliver/PopTracker/releases).
2. Open PopTracker, and load the Witness pack. 
3. Click on the "AP" symbol at the top.
4. Enter the AP address, slot name and password. 

The rest should take care of itself! Items and checks will be marked automatically, and it even knows your settings - It will hide checks & adjust logic accordingly.
