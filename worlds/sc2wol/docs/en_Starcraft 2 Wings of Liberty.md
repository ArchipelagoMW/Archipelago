# Starcraft 2 Wings of Liberty

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Items which the player would normally acquire throughout the game have been moved around. Logic remains, so the game is
always able to be completed.  Options exist to also shuffle around the mission order of the campaign.

## What is the goal of Starcraft 2 when randomized?

The goal remains unchanged. Beat the final mission All In.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

Unit unlocks, upgrade unlocks, armory upgrades, laboratory researches, and mercenary unlocks can be shuffled, and all
bonus objectives, side missions, mission completions are now locations that can contain these items.

## What has been changed from vanilla Starcraft 2?

Some missions have been given more vespene gas available to mine to allow for a wider variety of unit compositions on 
those missions.  Starports no longer require Factories in order to be built.  In 'A Sinister Turn' and 'Echoes 
of the Future', you can research protoss air armor and weapon upgrades.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any of the items which can be shuffled may also be placed into another player's world. It is possible to choose to limit
certain items to your own world.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

When the player receives an item, they will receive a message through their text client and in game if currently playing
 a mission.  They will immediately be able to use that unlock/upgrade.
