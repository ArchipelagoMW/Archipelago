# Starcraft 2 Wings of Liberty

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Items which the player would normally acquire throughout the game have been moved around. Logic remains, so the game is
always able to be completed, but because of the item shuffle the player may need to access certain areas before they
would in the vanilla game. All rings and spells are also randomized into those item locations, therefore you can no
longer craft them at the alchemist

## What is the goal of Starcraft 2 when randomized?

The goal remains unchanged. Beat the final mission All In.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

Unit unlocks, upgrade unlocks, armory upgrades, laboratory researches, and mercenary unlocks can be shuffled, and all
bonus objectives, side missions, mission completions are now locations that can contain these items.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any of the items which can be shuffled may also be placed into another player's world. It is possible to choose to limit
certain items to your own world.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

When the player receives an item, they will receive a message through their text client and in game if currently playing
 a mission.  They will immediately be able to use that unlock/upgrade.
