# Psychonauts

<h2 style="text-transform:none";>Changes from the vanilla game</h2>


This randomizer seeks to revitalize the original Psychonauts experience and add replayability by randomizing the locations of most items, and allowing access to minds to play them in any order through the Collective Unconscious. There are several options for ways to finish the game, allowing for different goals beyond beating the final boss.

In addition, there are other changes to the game that make it better optimized for a randomizer:

- Starting inventory always contains the Smelling Salts, Bacon, and 100 Psicores for redeeming Psicards in Ford's Sanctuary.
- Player starting location is the Collective Unconscious, with access to each mind locked behind Mind Unlock items.
- Psychic Powers are now Progressive Items, with Two to Three of each Power available.
- Access to the Campgrounds is locked by Sasha's Button, and other areas in the camp are locked as well:
    - The Kid's Cabins require Lili's Bracelet
    - The Reception Area requires the Squirrel Roast Dinner
    - The Lake requires the Oarsman's Badge
- The Camp progression is set to night time, just after Lili is kidnapped by Linda the Lungfish.
- Crossing the Lake to reach the Asylum requires using the Lungfish Call item.
- Emotional Baggage and Emotional Baggage Tags are no longer level specific.
- Sorting any piece of Emotional Baggage rewards one Rank Up.
- Memory Vaults now provide additional arrowheads and Rank Ups on opening.
- In Gloria’s Theater, the Megaphone item is no longer given to the player after giving the Knight of Joy script to Gloria, and is instead part of the collectibles pool. The scripts themselves are left untouched.
- New Randomizer Only Locations:
    - Basic Braining, End of Obstacle Course Platform (Two)
    - Milla’s Dance Party, Ending Room with Milla (One)
    - Lungfishopolis, Before the Kochamara Boss (Two)
    - Gloria’s Theater, Inside Gloria’s Room (One) 
    - Waterloo World, Reward for Helping the Carpenter, Knight, and each of the Three Villagers Respectively (Five)
    - Black Velvetopia, Reward for Defeating Each Wrestler (Four)
- Upon completing a level, Raz is returned to the Collective Unconscious instead of the vanilla game location. Additionally, an item will spawn outside the mental door as a reward.

<h2 style="text-transform:none";>What Psychonauts items can appear in other players' worlds?</h2>


Every item in the game except for Emotional Baggage.

<h2 style="text-transform:none";>What does another world's item look like in Psychonauts?</h2>


In Psychonauts, items which need to be sent to other worlds appear in any location that has an item in the vanilla game. They are represented by a Bunny collectible, and must be "picked up" as if it were a normal item. Upon obtaining the item, it will be sent to its home world.

<h2 style="text-transform:none";>When the player receives an item, what happens?</h2>


Receiving an item will always display an animation or text box when collected. If the item is normally stored inside Raz's inventory, it is added to your inventory. If the item is a physical game object, like a Memory Vault or Brain Jar, the item will automatically break and add its contents to your inventory. Some items, such as Emotional Baggage Tags or Mind Unlocks, will not directly display in the player's inventory, but will still be usable by the player when received.

<h2 style="text-transform:none";>Customization options:</h2>


- Choose a goal from the list below (with an additional option to complete Meat Circus Final Bosses alongside your goal).
    1. Defeat the Coach Oleander Brain Tank at the top of the Asylum.
    2. Obtain a desired amount of Camper Brains and re-brain them in Ford's Sanctuary.
    3. Combining the two previous goals. Find the required amount of Camper Brains, AND defeat the Coach Oleander Brain Tank.
