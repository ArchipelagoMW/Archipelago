# Metroid Prime

## How can I play this?

A playable version does not currently exist. Watch this space, because when it's ready instructions will be posted.

## What does randomization do to this game?

All items Samus would normally pick up are shuffled between worlds. Logic has been implemented so that the game
*should* be beatable, but if you run into an impossible seed let me know.

## What items and locations have been shuffled?

All suit upgrades (Morph Ball systems, beams, movement, etc.) as well as expansions (Missiles, Power Bombs, Energy
Tanks) and Chozo Artifacts. Right now, you will start with Power Beam, Power Suit, Combat Visor, and Scan Visor
just like in the base game, so these are not shuffled.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Anything that's been shuffled. If you'd like to force something to be in your world for convenience, you should be
able to do that eventually, but not at this current time.

## What does another world's item look like?

The client has not been developed yet, so this entirely depends on what is possible on that end.

## What happens when you receive an item?

Most likely, a message will appear right below your health bar claiming "[insert item] acquired!", at which point your
reserves or abilities will update accordingly.
