# Cat Quest Multiworld Setup Guide

## Required Software

- Cat Quest from: [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/593280/Cat_Quest/)
    - Games from other storefronts may work, but only if it's the 32 bit version. (EGS, Amazon and GOG are confirmed to be the 64 bit version unfortunately) 
- BepInEx from: [GitHub](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases)
- Cat Quest Randomizer from: [GitHub](https://github.com/Nikkilites/CatQuest-Randomizer/releases)
- Cat Quest World from: [GitHub](https://github.com/Nikkilites/Archipelago-CatQuest/releases)

## Installation

1. Download and install BepInEx 5 (x86, version 5.4.20 or newer) into your Cat Quest root folder. (Don't use the pre-release of 6)

2. Start Cat Quest once, so that BepInEx can create its required configuration files.

3. After BepInEx has been installed and configured, download the Cat Quest Randomizer zip file, move it to the Cat Quest root folder alongside Cat Quest.exe, right click and select "Extract Here" or the equivalent for your extraction software.
   After this, you can delete the .zip file

## Connecting

When you open your game, you should see the archipawlago menu screen and the randomizer version. 

Depending on how much you've played the game beforehand, the menu may look different.

If you have the 'New Game +' button, click it, and you should have a button called Start New Archipelago Game. 
Type in your room info and click confirm to start the game

If you have save data already (the continue button is lit up), then simply click 'New Game' and do as above.

if you do not have save data, click 'New Game', play the game until it saves for the first time, return to the menu and click 'New Game' again. Do as above.

You can continue your saved game by clicking Continue like in vanilla Cat Quest. This will automatically connect you to the slot you last played on.
