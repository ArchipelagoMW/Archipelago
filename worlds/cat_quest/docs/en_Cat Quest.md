# Cat Quest

## What does randomization do to this game?

In Cat Quest, all questlines are available from the beginning, and they no longer gain you any Exp or Gold. 

Items like Royal Arts, skills and the Golden Key can no longer be obtained 
through completing the usual quests associated with them.

## What Cat Quest items can appear in other players' worlds?

Royal Arts, Skills, The Golden Key, Gold and Exp can appear in other players' worlds.

## What does another world's item look like in Cat Quest?

You find other world's items by completing quests.
As of now, you will have to use your client to see which item you got.

## Can I have more than one save at a time?

No, unfortunately only one save slot is available for use in Cat Quest.
Starting a new save will erase the old one _permanently_.
If you want to save your actual vanilla save game, please do so before starting.
