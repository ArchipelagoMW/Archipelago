# The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains most of the options you need to 
configure and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Most acquirable pickups are shuffled among each other, following some logic to ensure the game ends up being completable.

Rare Maple drop is **not** randomized because it would not make much sense.

## What does another world's item look like in Oracle of Seasons?

Items belonging to other worlds use an easily recognizable Archipelago sprite, which is blue if the item is unimportant, and red if it is a progression item.
When collecting it, the game will inform you that you just sent an item to another player, and you can check on the client window to see which item was actually sent.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What does medium / hard logic expects from me?**

> - **Casual logic** only expects what you are forced to know when doing a casual playthrough of the game
> - **Medium logic** expects you to have a complete knowledge of the game, but nothing execution-heavy will be required (no tricks or glitches)
> - **Hard logic** expects you to use glitches and perform tricks such as bomb jumps
> 
> A [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IVYvvZS6NuTDoeWJlbFA5AW2Lj-nIaweRJkKuq7ncqc/) was built by Ishigh and the community to explain the breakdown between those logic levels more in detail. 

**Is there a tracker for this game?**

> Yes, Seto has built a Poptracker pack which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/seto10987/Oracle-of-Seasons-AP-Poptracker-Pack/releases).

**How can I warp to start?**

> You need to press A+B while the screen is fading to white into any menu (e.g. after pressing START or SELECT)

**How can I switch directly to a specific season instead of cycling all seasons everytime?**

> You can hold a diagonal on your directional pad right after having used the rod. This will switch directly to the season whose icon is placed in that direction next to the Rod of Seasons icon at the top of your screen. Timing is tight, but with some practice you will be able to save precious seconds.

**Can I do linked games using passwords from Oracle of Ages?**

> No, linked features are completely disabled in this randomizer since it changes the world events and locations too heavily to be reasonable to maintain.
