# Ocarina of Time

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Items which the player would normally acquire throughout the game have been moved around. Logic remains, so the game is
always able to be completed, but because of the item shuffle the player may need to access certain areas before they
would in the vanilla game. A list of perhaps non-obvious pieces of logic can be found
[here](https://wiki.ootrandomizer.com/index.php?title=Logic).

## What items and locations get shuffled?

All main inventory items, collectables, and ammunition can be shuffled, and all locations in the game which could
contain any of those items may have their contents changed. Gold Skultulla locations may also be included as necessary
checks at the user's discretion.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any of the items which can be shuffled may also be placed into another player's world. It is possible to choose to limit
certain items to your own world.

## What does another world's item look like in OoT?

Items belonging to other worlds are represented by the Zelda's Letter item.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

When the player receives an item, Link will hold the item above his head and display it to the world. It's good for
business!
