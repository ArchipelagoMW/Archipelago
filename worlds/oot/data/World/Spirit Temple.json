    # In the following two regions, child and adult reachability actually means age-unknown, but with
    # the caveat that that age can potentially enter the area. Routes must be anded with 5 keys for
    # child or 3 keys (or shortcuts on) for adult before they can use only items specific to that age.
    # Age-unknown routes do not specify age and must include the necessary items for both ages, so
    # that the checks can be collected regardless of which age actually has entered the area.
    # Routes that use two keys are age-unknown, where the checks are expected to be collected as
    # adult, but child might collect them instead if out-of-logic explosives have been found. Checking
    # bombchus_in_logic on and entrance_shuffle off ensures that those explosives cannot be exhausted.
    # Age-unknown logic is not deadend-proof in rare cases where some non-repeatable access is used
    # to reach the temple (only possible with Entrance Randomizer). This trade-off is worth it to
    # increase item placement variety, particularly when keys are shuffled within their own dungeons.
