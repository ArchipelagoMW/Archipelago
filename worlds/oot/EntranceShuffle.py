    # Gather locations to keep reachable for validation

    # Set entrance data for all entrances

    # Determine entrance pools based on settings

    # Mark shuffled entrances

    # Build target entrance pools

    # Place priority entrances

    # Delete priority targets from one-way pools

    # Shuffle all entrance pools, in order

    # Verification steps: 
    # All entrances are properly connected to a region
    # Game is beatable
    # Validate world
