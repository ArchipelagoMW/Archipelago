# EarthBound

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Randomization of EarthBound randomizes all items, from presents, PSI Locations, Character Locations, and gifts from NPCs.

## What is the goal of EarthBound when randomized?
By default, the goal is to reach the defined number of Sanctuaries, and then defeat Giygas at the Cave of the Past.
If Giygas is disabled, the game will end once the player reaches the required sanctuary number.
If Magicant is set to "required", players will need to defeat Ness's Nightmare in Magicant, unlocked upon reaching their required
Sanctuaries, before they can win.
Optionally, the player can set Alternate Goal conditions, on 1 or 2 sanctuaries more than required, but these will never be the expected
goal.

You can check your goals by speaking to Apple Kid in the Cave of the Present.


## What items and locations get shuffled?

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any shuffled item can be in other players' worlds.

## What does another world's item look like in EarthBound?
When collecting an item for another player, the item and player are identified as the receiver. If Shopsanity is enable, items for other players
in shops will display the player they are for below the shop window. When attempting to purchase an item for another player, the full name of the item and its receiver
will be displayed to confirm. If the 'Presents Match Contents' option is enabled, presents will display the Archipelago symbol if they contain an item for another player.

## What happens when I receive an item?
When you receive an item, the sound effect of an item being received will play, and it will be put in your inventory. If your inventory is full, it will automatically be put in storage.
!If storage is full, you will not be able to receive any more items until you clear room! If you receive PSI, the PSI learn fanfare plays instead. If you receive a character, a cutscene
will play.

## My inventory is full and there's items I can't find!
You can press R at any time on the overworld to access a pocket storage menu that allows you to store, withdraw from storage, and toss unnessecary items within one menu.

## What about Escargo Express? ##
Escargo Express's item storage has been replaced with a cross-game gift delivery system. From any phone, you can call Escargo Express to receive or send Gift items to other players.
In order for players to be eligible, they have to have gifting enabled. Your gift inbox can hold 69 gifted items at a time, and up to 10 items can be queued to be sent to other players.

## Hints? ##
In most major towns, you can find a helpful Hint Man who will give hints about your game... for a price.
The location of the Hint Man will be marked on your map, viewable at all times with X.

## Repel Sandwiches? ##
Skip Sandwiches (And Skip Sandwich DXs) have been replaced with an item called the Repel Sandwich (and Repel Superwich).
Repel Sandwiches will prevent normal enemies from spawning for a short time. The help text can tell you more.
