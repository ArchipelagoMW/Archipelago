# Kingdom Hearts (PC)

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains most of the options you need to 
configure and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

The Kingdom Hearts AP Randomizer randomizes most rewards in the game and adds several items which are used to unlock worlds, Olympus Coliseum cups, and world progression.

Worlds can only be accessed by finding the corresponding item.  For example, you need to find the `Monstro` item to enter Monstro.

The default goal is to enter End of the World and defeat Final Ansem.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

### Items

Any weapon, accessory, spell, trinity, summon, world, key item, stat up, consumable, or ability can be found in any location.

### Locations

Locations the player can find items include chests, event rewards, Atlantica clams, level up rewards, 101 Dalmatian rewards, and postcard rewards.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any of the items which can be shuffled may also be placed into another player's world. It is possible to choose to limit
certain items to your own world.
## When the player receives an item, what happens?

When the player receives an item, your client will display a message displaying the item you have obtained.  You will also see a notification in the "LEVEL UP" box.

## What do I do if I encounter a bug with the game?

Please reach out to Gicu#7034 on Discord.

## How do I progress in a certain world?

### The evidence boxes aren't spawning in Wonderland.

Find `Footprints` in the multiworld.

### I can't enter any cups in Olympus Coliseum.

Firstly, find `Entry Pass` in the multiworld.  Additionally, `Phil Cup`, `Pegasus Cup`, and `Hercules Cup` are all multiworld items.  Finding all 3 grant you access to the Hades Cup and the Platinum Match.  Clearing all cups lets you challenge Ice Titan.

### The slides aren't spawning in Deep Jungle.

Find `Slides` in the multiworld.

### I can't progress in Atlantica.
Find `Crystal Trident` in the multiworld.

### I can't progress in Halloween Town.

Find `Forget-Me-Not` and `Jack-in-the-Box` in the multiworld.

### The Hollow Bastion Library is missing a book.

Find `Theon Vol. 6` in the multiworld.

## How do I enter the End of the World?

You can enter End of the World by obtaining a number of Ansem's Reports or by finding `End of the World` in the multiworld, depending on your options.
