# Kingdom Hearts Randomizer Setup Guide

## Setting up the required mods

The KH1 AP Randomizer now requires external software to generate your mod.
Setting up this software is subject to change.  You can find the most recent instructions for setting up your
the mods after generation on the [KH1 AP Randomizer website](https://www.kh1fmrando.com/setup_guide.html)

## Configuring your YAML file

### What is a YAML file and why do I need one?

Your YAML file contains a set of configuration options which provide the generator with information about how it should
generate your game. Each player of a multiworld will provide their own YAML file. This setup allows each player to enjoy
an experience customized for their taste, and different players in the same multiworld can all have different options.

### Where do I get a YAML file?

you can customize your settings by visiting the [Kingdom Hearts Options Page](/games/Kingdom%20Hearts/player-options).

## Connect to the MultiWorld

For first-time players, it is recommended to open your KH1 Client first before opening the game.

On the title screen, open your KH1 Client and connect to your multiworld.
