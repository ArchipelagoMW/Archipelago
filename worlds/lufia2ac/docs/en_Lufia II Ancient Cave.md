# Lufia II - Rise of the Sinistrals (Ancient Cave)

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

As you may or may not know, randomization was already a core feature of the Ancient Cave in Lufia II, basically being a
whole game within a game. The Ancient Cave has 99 floors with increasingly hard enemies, red chests and blue chests. At
the end of the Ancient Cave you get to fight the Royal Jelly... if you make it that far. You cannot lose the Royal
Jelly fight as it kills itself after giving you three rounds to try and kill it (or manage to vanquish your own party, 
whichever one you can manage).

The Randomizer allows you to set four different goals (Kill the Boss, Iris Treasure Hunt, Treasure hunt + Boss, Reach 
final floor), and modify the game in several other ways (define where the last floor is, start with providence, choose
custom levels/evolution stages for your capsule monsters, etc.). 

## What items and locations get shuffled?

In general, all Items can appear in the red and blue chests, the blue chest items are items you get to keep after you
die in or escape the Ancient Cave using Providence. Archipelago Items can also appear in said chests. Iris Treasures are
always in your local game.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any of the blue chest items from the vanilla game may be placed into another player's world.

## What does another world's item look like in Lufia II?

Items belonging to other worlds are represented by an AP icon and are called AP items.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

Your Party Leader will hold up the item they received when not in a fight or in a menu.
