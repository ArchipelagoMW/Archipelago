## Archipelago Text Client

We recommend having Archipelago's Text Client open on the side to keep track of what items you receive and send.
Daxanadu doesn't display messages. You'll only get popups when picking them up.

## Auto-Tracking

Daxanadu has an integrated tracker that can be toggled in the options.
