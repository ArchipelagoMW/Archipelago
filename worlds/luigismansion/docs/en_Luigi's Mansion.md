# Luigi's Mansion

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

When it comes to Luigi's Mansion, randomization changes the locations of Mario's Items, door keys and element medallions,
as well as all the treasures that are found in chests. This primarily changes the route the player must take 
through the game.

The Randomizer allows you to set different goals and modify the game in several other ways
([see below](#changes-from-the-vanilla-game)). 

## What items and locations get shuffled?

Door Keys, Mario's items, and the element medallions are shuffled. These are found in the chests in various rooms in the 
mansion, as well as a few specific objects that normally contain those items. There are options for Boos, Portrait Ghosts, Toads, Plants, Gold Mice, Blue 
Ghosts (Speedy Spirits), and even every interactable object in the game.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Keys, Mario's Items, and Element Medals can be found in other worlds, along with money, hearts, and a variety of traps.

## What does another world's item look like in Luigi's Mansion?

Items belonging to other worlds are represented by an AP icon and are called AP items.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

items received in Luigi's Mansion will display a popup window that does not interrupt gameplay..
