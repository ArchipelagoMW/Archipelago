# Luigi's Mansion

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

When it comes to Luigi's Mansion, randomization changes the locations of Mario's Items, door keys and element medallions,
as well as all the treasures that are found in chests. This primarily changes the route the player must take 
through the game.

The Randomizer allows you to set different goals and modify the game in several other ways
([see below](#changes-from-the-vanilla-game)). 

## What items and locations get shuffled?

Door Keys, Mario's items, and the element medallions are shuffled. These are found in the chests in various rooms in the 
mansion, as well as a few specific objects that normally contain those items. There are options for Boos, Portrait Ghosts, Toads, Plants, Gold Mice, Blue 
Ghosts (Speedy Spirits), and even every interactable object in the game.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Keys, Mario's Items, and Element Medals can be found in other worlds, along with money , hearts, and poison mushrooms.

## What does another world's item look like in Luigi's Mansion?

Items belonging to other worlds are represented by an AP icon and are called AP items.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

_______. 

## Changes from the vanilla game

###### Customization options:

- Add Toads into the pool as locations
- Add every interactable object within the game into the pool as locations
- Require the player to have obatined enough money to get a specific rank upon completion.

###### Quality of life:

- Various streamlining tweaks (removed cutscenes, dialogue, transitions, and animations)
- The Blackout can be toggled from the breaker in the breaker room, to access certain locations of the game.
- 
- 
- 

###### Quality of death:

- Blue chest items that you received from the multiworld are kept, even if your party dies. (I.e., you do not need to
  use Providence to make them permanent)
- Similarly, but in the opposite direction: All location checks you make are immediately sent out to the multiworld and
  don't require Providence for persistence.
- (optional) Death link support. (I.e., if your party is defeated, everyone else participating in death link also dies)

###### Bug fixes:

- Vanilla game bugs that could result in softlocks or save file corruption have been fixed
- (optional) Bugfix for the algorithm that determines the item pool for red chest gear. Enabling this allows the cave to
  generate shields, headgear, rings, and jewels in red chests even after floor B9
- (optional) Bugfix for the outlandish cravings of capsule monsters in the US version. Enabling this makes feeding work
  like in the JP and EU versions of the game, resulting in more reasonable cravings
