Thank you, Luigi, but Mario is in{BreakHere}another Mansion.
Hey, I'm cryin' here!
This is an intervention.{BreakHere}You and your brother need to lay off{BreakHere}the shrooms.
This is an intervention.{BreakHere}Your brother and you keep mistaking{BreakHere}toads for mushrooms and eating them.
Think Luigi!{BreakHere}Why would anyone give away a free{BreakHere}mansion?{BreakHere}Only if it was haunted!
Have you met Nana yet?{BreakHere}I love playing with her balls!{BreakHere}The yarn is so soft.
I love shorts!{BreakHere} They're comfy and easy to wear!
Phar, why
FBI OPEN UP!
I hear you're having a bad{BreakHere}time, Luigi.{BreakHere}Uncle Toad can help with that,{BreakHere}for a price.
You've met with a terrible{BreakHere}fate, haven't you?
Wait a minute, that's not a{BreakHere}F.L.U.D.D. on your back,{BreakHere}you fake Mario!
My tears contain a magic pixie{BreakHere}juice that turns on light bulbs.
Can't a toad cry in peace around{BreakHere}here?
Oh gosh, if you're here Luigi,{BreakHere}that means Mario is on his way!{BreakHere}We're saved!
Oh great, it's Mario's bum brother.{BreakHere}We're doomed.
I wish I bit the bullet and{BreakHere}bought those tickets to Delfino{BreakHere}with Peach.{BreakHere}Now I'm stuck here instead!
Do you think Rosalina is hiring{BreakHere}new staff for her observatory?
Sorry, I was crying because{BreakHere}Goombas get better healthcare than{BreakHere}we do
Ah-ha! You triggered my{BreakHere}trap card!{BreakHere}It allows me to play Pot of Greed,{BreakHere}to draw two cards!
At least Peach pays us better{BreakHere}than JojaMart.
I know how to yell in hexadecimal.{BreakHere}AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA{BreakHere}AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA{BreakHere}AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA{BreakHere}AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA{BreakHere}AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
So here you are again.{BreakHere}Playing another Archipelago seed.{BreakHere}You know what you could be doing?{BreakHere}Playing your backlog.{BreakHere}But no, gotta play them classics.
You know, you've got games sitting{BreakHere}on your shelf begging to be played,{BreakHere}but you're talking to me instead.
It's dangerous to go alone!{BreakHere}Take this.
What is a man?{BreakHere}A miserable little pile of secrets!
Hey! Listen!
I used to be an adventurer like you,{BreakHere}until I took an arrow to the knee.
Stop right there,{BreakHere}criminal scum!
Welcome to the world of the mansion!{BreakHere}Are you a Mario or a Lui-{BreakHere}Oh, Hi Luigi.
I'm Commander Toadstool{BreakHere}and this is my favorite mansion{BreakHere}in the Mushroom Kingdom!
Have you ever played Junimo Kart?{BreakHere}I love it,{BreakHere}it's just a nice chill game.
Look man,{BreakHere}I'd tell you where an item is,{BreakHere}but I don't want the{BreakHere}APPD to come down on me.
Did you follow the sign?{BreakHere}1. Play Vanilla{BreakHere}2. Play Solo Rando{BreakHere}3. Play Multiworld
Your mother was a hamster{BreakHere}and your father smelt of elderberries!
You{BreakHere}have{BreakHere}an{BreakHere}item{BreakHere}somewhere{BreakHere}in{BreakHere}Luigi's{BreakHere}Mansion.
Excuse me, I'm Looking for the{BreakHere}Mario Party plaza?
Psst.{BreakHere}Hey, Luigi!{BreakHere}I got the goods.{BreakHere}You got the stuff?
Do you think if I cry enough,{BreakHere}I'll turn myself into mushroom soup?
I finally found you!{BreakHere}Faker!
Boo!{BreakHere} {BreakHere} {BreakHere} {BreakHere} {BreakHere} {BreakHere}Did I scare you?
dtdrd dfr dczetdrg?{BreakHere}rddsfd fd sde rrfd srdedsdcd!
Anime was a mistake.
How did I get to{BreakHere}the mansion before you?{BreakHere}Don't concern yourself{BreakHere}with such things
I hear there's a check for pressing{BreakHere}the "Mario" button 100 times.
I hear the Bahamas are nice this{BreakHere}time of year, but Boolossus{BreakHere}always goes there on holiday
Last time Boolossus went to the{BreakHere}Bahamas, he left all his luggage{BreakHere}there for a week!
King Boo's crown is the source of{BreakHere}his power.{BreakHere}If you don't grab it,{BreakHere}you'll be lost in the void forever!
A 1 ounce bird cannot carry a{BreakHere}5 pound coconut!
Kingdom Hearts!{BreakHere}Fill me with the power of darkness!
But can you think inside{BreakHere}the chimney?
Did you make sure to check{BreakHere}Aginah's Cave?
What you're looking for could be{BreakHere}at the top of Fire Temple
Hoo hoot!{BreakHere}Luigi... Look up here!{BreakHere}It appears that the time has{BreakHere}finally come for you to start{BreakHere}your adventure!{BreakHere}You will encounter many hardships{BreakHere}ahead...{BreakHere}That is your fate.{BreakHere}Don't feel discouraged,{BreakHere}even during the toughest times!{BreakHere}Go straight this way and you{BreakHere}will see Mario's Painting.{BreakHere}You will meet a princess there...{BreakHere}If you are lost and don't know{BreakHere}which way to go, look at the Map.{BreakHere}The areas you have explored will{BreakHere}be shown on the map.{BreakHere}Press Y to find the map.{BreakHere}On the map subscreen, you will also{BreakHere}see spinning keys showing you{BreakHere}which way to go next.{BreakHere}Did you get all that?{BreakHere}Alright then, I'll see you around!{BreakHere}Hoot Hoot Hoot Ho!
Sorry, I was trying to see if my{BreakHere}tears could run Doom.
