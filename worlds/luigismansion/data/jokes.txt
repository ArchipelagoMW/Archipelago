Thank you, Luigi, but Mario is in \\ another Mansion.
Hey, I'm cryin' here!
This is an intervention. \\ You and your brother need to lay off \\ the shrooms.
This is an intervention. \\ Your brother and you keep mistaking \\ toads for mushrooms and eating them.
Think Luigi! \\ Why would anyone give away a free \\ mansion? \\ Only if it was haunted!
Have you met Nana yet? \\ I love playing with her balls! \\ The yarn is so soft.
I love shorts!\\  They're comfy and easy to wear!
Phar, why
FBI OPEN UP!
I hear you're having a bad \\ time, Luigi. \\ Uncle Toad can help with that,\\ for a price.
You've met with a terrible \\ fate, haven't you?
Wait a minute, that's not a \\ F.L.U.D.D. on your back, \\ you fake Mario!
My tears contain a magic pixie \\ juice that turns on light bulbs.
Can't a toad cry in peace around \\ here?
Oh gosh, if you're here Luigi, \\ that means Mario is on his way! \\ We're saved!
Oh great, it's Mario's bum brother. \\ We're doomed.
I wish I bit the bullet and \\ bought those tickets to Delfino \\ with Peach.\\ Now I'm stuck here instead!
Do you think Rosalina is hiring \\ new staff for her observatory?
Sorry, I was crying because \\ Goombas get better healthcare than\\ we do
Ah-ha! You triggered my \\ trap card! \\ It allows me to play Pot of Greed,\\ to draw two cards!
At least Peach pays us better \\ than JojaMart.
I know how to yell in hexadecimal. \\ AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\\ AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\\ AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\\ AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\\ AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
So here you are again.\\ Playing another Archipelago seed.\\ You know what you could be doing? \\ Playing your backlog. \\ But no, gotta play them classics.
You know, you've got games sitting\\ on your shelf begging to be played,\\ but you're talking to me instead.
It's dangerous to go alone!\\ Take this.
What is a man?\\ A miserable little pile of secrets!
Hey! Listen!
I used to be an adventurer like you,\\ until I took an arrow to the knee.
Stop right there, criminal scum!
Welcome to the world of the mansion!\\ Are you a Mario or a Lui- Oh, Hi Luigi.
I'm Commander Toadstool\\ and this is my favorite mansion\\ in the Mushroom Kingdom!
Have you ever played Junimo Cart?\\ I love it,\\ it's just a nice chill game.
Look man,\\ I'd tell you where an item is,\\ but I don't want the\\ APPD to come down on me.
Did you follow the sign?\\ 1. Play Vanilla\\ 2. Play Solo Rando\\ 3. Play Multiworld
Your mother was a hamster\\ and your father smelt of elderberries!
You\\ have\\ an\\ item\\ somewhere\\ in\\ Luigi's\\ Mansion.
