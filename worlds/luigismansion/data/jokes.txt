Thank you, Luigi, but Mario is in\\nanother Mansion.
Hey, I'm cryin' here!
This is an intervention.\\nYou and your brother need to lay off\\nthe shrooms.
This is an intervention.\\nYour brother and you keep mistaking\\ntoads for mushrooms and eating them.
Think Luigi!\\nWhy would anyone give away a free\\nmansion?\\nOnly if it was haunted!
Have you met Nana yet?\\nI love playing with her balls!\\nThe yarn is so soft.
I love shorts!\\n They're comfy and easy to wear!
Phar, why
FBI OPEN UP!
I hear you're having a bad\\ntime, Luigi.\\nUncle Toad can help with that,\\nfor a price.
You've met with a terrible\\nfate, haven't you?
Wait a minute, that's not a\\nF.L.U.D.D. on your back,\\nyou fake Mario!
My tears contain a magic pixie\\njuice that turns on light bulbs.
Can't a toad cry in peace around\\nhere?
Oh gosh, if you're here Luigi,\\nthat means Mario is on his way!\\nWe're saved!
Oh great, it's Mario's bum brother.\\nWe're doomed.
I wish I bit the bullet and\\nbought those tickets to Delfino\\nwith Peach.\\nNow I'm stuck here instead!
Do you think Rosalina is hiring\\nnew staff for her observatory?
Sorry, I was crying because\\nGoombas get better healthcare than\\nwe do
Ah-ha! You triggered my\\ntrap card!\\nIt allows me to play Pot of Greed,\\nto draw two cards!
At least Peach pays us better\\nthan JojaMart.
I know how to yell in hexadecimal.\\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
So here you are again.\\nPlaying another Archipelago seed.\\nYou know what you could be doing?\\nPlaying your backlog.\\nBut no, gotta play them classics.
You know, you've got games sitting\\non your shelf begging to be played,\\nbut you're talking to me instead.
It's dangerous to go alone!\\nTake this.
What is a man?\\nA miserable little pile of secrets!
Hey! Listen!
I used to be an adventurer like you,\\nuntil I took an arrow to the knee.
Stop right there,\\ncriminal scum!
Welcome to the world of the mansion!\\nAre you a Mario or a Lui-\\nOh, Hi Luigi.

Have you ever played Junimo Kart?\\nI love it,\\nit's just a nice chill game.
Look man,\\nI'd tell you where an item is,\\nbut I don't want the\\nAPPD to come down on me.
Did you follow the sign?\\n1. Play Vanilla\\n2. Play Solo Rando\\n3. Play Multiworld

Anime was a mistake.
How did I get to\\nthe mansion before you?\\nDon't concern yourself\\nwith such things
I hear there's a check for pressing\\nthe "Mario" button 100 times.
I hear the Bahamas are nice this\\ntime of year, but Boolossus\\nalways goes there on holiday
Last time Boolossus went to the\\nBahamas, he left all his luggage\\nthere for a week!
King Boo's crown is the source of\\nhis power.\\nIf you don't grab it,\\nyou'll be lost in the void forever!
A 1 ounce bird cannot carry a\\n5 pound coconut!
Kingdom Hearts!\\nFill me with the power of darkness!
But can you think inside\\nthe chimney?
Did you make sure to check\\nAginah's Cave?
What you're looking for could be\\nat the top of Fire Temple
