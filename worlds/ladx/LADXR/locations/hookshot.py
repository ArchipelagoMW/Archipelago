"""
The hookshot is dropped by the master stalfos.
The master stalfos drops a "key" with, and modifies a bunch of properties:

    ld   a, $30                                   ; $7EE1: $3E $30
    call SpawnNewEntity_trampoline                ; $7EE3: $CD $86 $3B

And then the dropped key handles the rest with room number specific code.
As we patched the dropped key, this requires no extra handling.
