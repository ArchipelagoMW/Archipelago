## Installing the Archipelago mod to Muse Dash

1. Download [MelonLoader.Installer.exe](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases/tag/v0.6.1) and run it.
2. Choose the automated tab, click the select button and browse to `MuseDash.exe`. Then click install.
  - You can find the folder in steam by finding the game in your library, right clicking it and choosing *Manage→Browse Local Files*.
  - If you click the bar at the top telling you your current folder, this will give you a path you can copy. If you paste that into the window popped up by **MelonLoader**, it will automatically go to the same folder.
3. Run the game once, and wait until you get to the Muse Dash screen before exiting.
4. Download the latest [Muse Dash Archipelago Mod](https://github.com/DeamonHunter/ArchipelagoMuseDash/releases/latest) and then extract that into the newly created `/Mods/` folder in MuseDash's install location.
  - All files must be under the `/Mods/` folder and not a sub folder within `/Mods/`

If you've successfully installed everything, a button will appear in the bottom right which will allow you to log into an Archipelago server.

## Generating a MultiWorld Game

  - (For instructions on how to generate an Archipelago game, refer to the [Archipelago Web Guide](../../../../tutorial/Archipelago/using_website/en))

## Joining a MultiWorld Game

2. Enter in the details for the archipelago game, such as the server address with port (i.e archipelago.gg:38381), username and password.
