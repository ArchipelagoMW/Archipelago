## What Does Randomisation do to this Game?

//Todo: Rewrite to reflect other added goals

Muse Dash, being a rhythm game, does not have much randomisation. In order to facilitate Archipelago, the available choices of songs are limited. Upon completing songs, you will get multiple checks, which may include more songs to play.

To help make more interesting runs, each song will give 2 items, instead of the typical 1.

## What is the goal of Muse Dash in Archipelago

//Todo: Add other goals

The goal of Muse Dash in Archipelago is to complete the song marked as "Goal". The goal is always visible, and is always marked, but cannot be played until it is unlocked by another song.

## What is required to play the game?

The **Just as Planned DLC** is required in order to play this randomiser. //Todo: possibly allow the base game under limited options

### What Adjustments have been made to the Base Game?
- The ability to play all songs regardless of level
- //Todo: More adjustments will probably be made
