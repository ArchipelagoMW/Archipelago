## What does randomization do to this game?

Certain interactable objects within levels will be unable to be used until the corresponding item is found. If the item is not in the player's posession, the object will flash and will not function. Objects include:
- Spring Ball
- Large Spring Ball 
- ! Switch
- Dashed Platform
- Dashed Stairs
- Beanstalk
- Arrow Wheel
- Vanishing Arrow Wheel
- Ice, fire, and normal watermelons
- Super Star
- Flashing Eggs
- Giant Eggs
- Egg Launcher
- Egg Refill Plant
- Chomp Rock
- Poochy
- Transformation Morphs
- Skis
- Platform Ghost
- Middle Rings
- Buckets
- Tulips

Yoshi will start out being able to carry only one egg, and 5 capacity upgrades can be found to bring the total up to 6.
The player will start with all levels unlocked in their starting world, and can collect 'World Gates' to unlock levels from other worlds.
Extra and Bonus stages will also start out locked, and require respective items to access them. 6-8 is locked, and will be unlocked
upon reaching the number of boss clears defined by the player.
Other checks will grant the player extra lives, consumables for use in the inventory, or traps.

Additionally, the player is able to randomize the bosses found at the end of boss stages, the order of stages,
the world they start in, the starting amount of lives, route through 6-8, and the color of Yoshi for each stage.

## What is the goal of Yoshi's Island when randomized?

The player can choose one of two goals:
- Bowser: Defeat a pre-defined number of bosses, and defeat Bowser at the end of 6-8.
- Luigi Hunt: Collect a pre-defined number of 'Pieces of Luigi' within levels.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

Locations consist of 'level objectives', that being:
- Beating the stage
- Collecting 20 red coins.
- Collecting 5 flowers.
- Collecting 30 stars.

Checks will be sent immediately upon achieving that objective, regardless of if the stage is cleared or not.
Additional checks can be placed on Bandit mini-battles, or overworld minigames.


## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any shuffled item can be in other players' worlds.

## What does another world's item look like in Yoshi's Island

Items do not have an appearance in Yoshi's Island

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

When the player recieves an item, a fanfare or sound will be heard to reflect the item received. Most items, aside from Egg Capacity and level unlocks, can be checked on the menu by pressing SELECT.
If an item is in the queue and has not been received, checks will not be processed.
