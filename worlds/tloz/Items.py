# Item prices are going to get a bit of a writeup here, because these are some seemingly arbitrary
# design decisions and future contributors may want to know how these were arrived at.

# First, I based everything off of the Blue Ring. Since the Red Ring is twice as good as the Blue Ring,
# logic dictates it should cost twice as much. Since you can't make something cost 500 rupees, the only
# solution was to halve the price of the Blue Ring. Correspondingly, everything else sold in shops was
# also cut in half.

# Then, I decided on a factor for swords. Since each sword does double the damage of its predecessor, each
# one should be at least double. Since the sword saves so much time when upgraded (as, unlike other items,
# you don't need to switch to it), I wanted a bit of a premium on upgrades. Thus, a 4x multiplier was chosen,
# allowing the basic Sword to stay cheap while making the Magical Sword be a hefty upgrade you'll
# feel the price of.

# Since arrows do the same amount of damage as the White Sword and silver arrows are the same with the Magical Sword.
# they were given corresponding costs.

# Utility items were based on the prices of the shield, keys, and food. Broadly useful utility items should cost more,
# while limited use utility items should cost less. After eyeballing those, a few editorial decisions were made as
# deliberate thumbs on the scale of game balance. Those exceptions will be noted below. In general, prices were chosen
# based on how a player would feel spending that amount of money as opposed to how useful an item actually is.
