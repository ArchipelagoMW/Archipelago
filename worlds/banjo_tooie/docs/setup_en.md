# SETUP GUIDE FOR BANJO-TOOIE ARCHIPELAGO

## Important

As we are using BizHawk, this guide is only applicable to Windows and Linux systems.
Our implementation also supports the Everdrive 3.0 and X7. (USB Support)

## Required Software/Files

-   PC Emulation:
    -   BizHawk:  [BizHawk Releases from TASVideos](https://tasvideos.org/BizHawk/ReleaseHistory)
        -   Version <b>2.9.1</b> and later are supported.
        -   Detailed installation instructions for BizHawk can be found at the above link.
        -   Windows users must run the prereq installer first, which can also be found at the above link.
-   Everdrive:
    - Install the USB driver on the PC that will be connecting to the everdrive
        - Windows: https://ftdichip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CDM212364_Setup.zip
        - Linux: https://ftdichip.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/libftd2xx-x86_64-1.4.27.tgz
    - For Everdrive 3.0, the OS version needs to be 3.06 to be compatible.
    - The Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak is required
-   Grab the latest release from https://github.com/jjjj12212/Archipelago-BanjoTooie
-   A Banjo-Tooie ROM (USA ONLY).

## Configuring BizHawk

Once BizHawk has been installed, open EmuHawk and change the following settings:

-   Under Config > Customize, check the "Run in background" and "Accept background input" boxes. This will allow you to continue playing in the background, even if another window is selected.
-   Under Config > Hotkeys, many hotkeys are listed, with many bound to common keys on the keyboard. You will likely want to disable most of these, which you can do quickly using  `Esc`.
-   If playing with a controller, when you bind controls, disable "P1 A Up", "P1 A Down", "P1 A Left", and "P1 A Right" as these interfere with aiming if bound. Set directional input using the Analog tab instead.
-   Under N64 enable "Use Expansion Slot". (The N64 menu only appears after loading a ROM.)
-   Under Config -> Speed/Skip, click "Audio Throttle" as this will fix the off pitch sounds while playing

It is strongly recommended to associate N64 rom extensions (*.n64, *.z64) to the EmuHawk we've just installed. To do so, we simply have to search any N64 rom we happened to own, right click and select "Open withâ€¦", unfold the list that appears and select the bottom option "Look for another application", then browse to the BizHawk folder and select EmuHawk.exe.

If you are experiencing performance issues with Banjo-Tooie, you can try the following:
- Under N64 -> Plugins, Set Active Video Plugin to Rice.
This will create some visual artifacts however, it should not affect gameplay.

## Configuring Everdrive

For those who wish to play this randomizer on Actual N64 Hardware:
- You will need a USB connection between the PC that will have the Banjo-Tooie Client Running and the Everdrive
- Install the USB driver on the PC that will be connecting to the everdrive
    - Windows: https://ftdichip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CDM212364_Setup.zip
    - Linux 64-bit: https://ftdichip.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/libftd2xx-x86_64-1.4.27.tgz
- For Everdrive 3.0, the OS version needs to be 3.06 to be compatible.
