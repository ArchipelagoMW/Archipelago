# Shivers

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
configuration file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

All Ixupi pot pieces are randomized. Keys have been added to the game to lock off different rooms in the museum, 
these are randomized. Crawling has been added and is required to use any crawl space.
Randomization can also control if Ixupi pots are in pieces, mixed, or complete, and in which worlds they will show up in.

## What is considered a location check in Shivers?

1. All puzzle solves are location checks. 
2. All Ixupi captures are location checks.
3. Puzzle hints/solutions are location checks. For example, looking at the Atlantis map.
4. Optionally information plaques are location checks.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

If the player receives a key then the corresponding door will be unlocked. If the player receives a pot piece, it is placed into a pot piece storage location.

## What is the victory condition?

Victory is achieved when the player has captured the required number Ixupi set in their options.
