# Dark Souls III Randomizer Setup Guide

## Required Software

- [Dark Souls III](https://store.steampowered.com/app/374320/DARK_SOULS_III/)
- [Dark Souls III AP Client](https://github.com/Marechal-L/Dark-Souls-III-Archipelago-client/releases)

## General Concept

The Dark Souls III AP Client is a dinput8.dll triggered when launching Dark Souls III. This .dll file will launch a command 
prompt where you can read information about your run and write any command to interact with the Archipelago server.  

The randomization is performed by the AP.json file, an output file generated by the Archipelago server.

## Installation Procedures

**This mod can ban you permanently from the FromSoftware servers if used online.**

This client has only been tested with the Official Steam version of the game (v1.15/1.35) not matter which DLCs are installed.

Get the dinput8.dll from the [Dark Souls III AP Client](https://github.com/Marechal-L/Dark-Souls-III-Archipelago-client/releases).
Then you need to add the two following files at the root folder of your game (e.g. "SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\DARK SOULS III\Game"):
- **dinput8.dll**
- **AP.json** : The .json file downloaded from the multiworld room or provided by the host, named AP-{ROOM_ID}.json, has to be renamed to AP.json.

## Joining a MultiWorld Game

1. Run DarkSoulsIII.exe or run the game through Steam
2. Type in "/connect {SERVER_IP}:{SERVER_PORT}" in the "Windows Command Prompt" that opened
3. Once connected, create a new game, choose a class and wait for the others before starting
4. You can quit and launch at anytime during a game

## Where do I get a config file?

The [Player Settings](/games/Dark%20Souls%20III/player-settings) page on the website allows you to
configure your personal settings and export them into a config file
