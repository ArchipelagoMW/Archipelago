# Dark Souls III

## Where is the options page?

config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Items that can be picked up from static corpses, taken from chests, or earned from defeating enemies or NPCs can be
randomized. Common pickups like titanite shards or firebombs can be randomized as "progressive" items. That is, the
location "Titanite Shard #5" is the fifth titanite shard you pick up, no matter where it was from. This is also what
happens when you randomize Estus Shards and Undead Bone Shards.

It's also possible to randomize the upgrade level of weapons and shields as well as their infusions (if they can have
one). Additionally, there are options that can make the randomized experience more convenient or more interesting, such as
removing weapon requirements or auto-equipping whatever equipment you most recently received.

The goal is to find the four "Cinders of a Lord" items randomized into the multiworld and defeat the Soul of Cinder.

## What Dark Souls III items can appear in other players' worlds?

spells, upgrade materials, etc...

## What does another world's item look like in Dark Souls III?

In Dark Souls III, items which are sent to other worlds appear as Prism Stones.
