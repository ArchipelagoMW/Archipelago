# Dark Souls III Items

## Item Groups

The Dark Souls III randomizer supports a number of item group names, which can
be used in YAML options like `local_items` to refer to many items at once:

* **Progression:** Items which unlock locations.
* **Cinders:** All four Cinders of a Lord. Once you have these four, you can
  fight Soul of Cinder and win the game.
* **Miscellaneous:** Generic stackable items, such as arrows, firebombs, buffs,
  and so on.
* **Unique:** Items that are unique per NG cycle, such as scrolls, keys, ashes,
  and so on. Doesn't include equipment, spells, or souls.
* **Boss Souls:** Souls that can be traded with Ludleth, including Soul of
  Rosaria.
* **Small Souls:** Soul items, not including boss souls.
* **Upgrade:** Upgrade items, including titanite, gems, and Shriving Stones.
* **Healing:** Undead Bone Shards and Estus Shards.
