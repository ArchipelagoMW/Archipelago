# Portal 2 Setup Guide

## Required Software

- [Archipelago](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases/latest)
- [Portal 2 apworld](https://github.com/GlassToadstool/Archipelago/releases)
- [Portal 2 Archipelago Mod](https://github.com/GlassToadstool/Portal2ArchipelagoMod)

## Portal 2 Client Setup

Portal 2 Archipelago requires a dedicated client that is packaged with the apworld and will be accessible from the Archipelago launcher when you install the apworld.

## Portal 2 Archipelago Mod Setup 

Follow the instructions on the [Portal 2 Archipelago Mod](https://github.com/GlassToadstool/Portal2ArchipelagoMod) page for installation and setup of the mod.

## How to play

Setting up a game is the same as all other archipelago multiworlds. You can find instuctions for generating a game [here](/tutorial/Archipelago/setup_en#generating-a-game). Hosting a game can be done on [archipelago.gg](https://archipelago.gg) or locally from the Host app in the launcher (mostly for single player games).

You must have the Portal 2 Client connected to a server and the Portal 2 Archipelago Mod open in order to play. When you have both of these open and you are connected to an archipelago game you are ready to play!
