## Required Software

- Any ChecksMate client. Currently, a modified ChessV client is supported and can be accessed via
  its [Github releases Page](https://github.com/chesslogic/chessv/releases) (latest version)
- Archipelago from the [Archipelago Releases Page](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases)
    - (select `ChecksMate Client` during installation.)

## Configuring your YAML file

### What is a YAML file and why do I need one?

See the guide on setting up a basic YAML at the Archipelago setup
guide: [Basic Multiworld Setup Guide](/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en)

Some releases of the ChecksMate client include an example YAML file demonstrating some supported options.

### Where do I get a YAML file?

You can customize your settings by visiting the [ChecksMate Player Settings Page](/games/ChecksMate/player-settings)

### Generating a ChecksMate game

**ChecksMate is a short game! You might restart many times, but you should expect no more than an hour of gameplay!**

When you join a multiworld game, you will be asked to provide your YAML file to whoever is hosting. Once that is done,
the host will provide you with either a link to download your data file, or with a zip file containing everyone's data
files. You do not have a file inside that zip though!

You need to start the ChecksMate client yourself, it is located within the Archipelago folder.

### Connect to the MultiServer

First start ChecksMate.

Once ChecksMate is started. In the client at the top type in the spot labeled `Server` type the `Ip Address` and `Port`
separated with a `:` symbol. Then input your slot name in the next box. The third box can be used for any password,
which is often left empty.

### Play the game

When the console tells you that you have joined the room, you're all set. Congratulations on successfully joining a
multiworld game!
