# Hexcells Infinite

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Every level is now randomly generated, akin to the seeded level generator already present in-game. All level perfects (no mistakes) provide a location.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Other players will find your Gems (the little blue pips that you normally get for completeing a level). These are required to unlock levels.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

Currently, the BepInEx Console is the only way to see items being received.
