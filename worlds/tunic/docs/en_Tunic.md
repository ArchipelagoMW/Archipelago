# TUNIC

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

In the TUNIC Randomizer, every item in the game is randomized. All chests, key item pickups, instruction manual pages, hero relics,
and other unique items are shuffled.<br>

Ability shuffling is an option available from the settings page to shuffle certain abilities (prayer, holy cross, and the ice rod combo),
preventing them from being used until they are unlocked.<br>

Enemy randomization is also available and can be turned on in the client mod.

## What is the goal of TUNIC when randomized?
The standard goal is the same as the vanilla game, which is to find the three hexagon keys, at which point you may either Take Your
Rightful Place or seek another path and Share Your Wisdom.

Alternatively, Hexagon Quest is a mode that shuffles a certain number of Gold "Questagons" into the item pool, with the goal 
being to find the required amount of them and then Share Your Wisdom.

## What items from TUNIC can appear in another player's world?
Every item has a chance to appear in another player's world.

## How many checks are in TUNIC?
There are 302 checks located across the world of TUNIC.

## What do items from other worlds look like in TUNIC?
Items belonging to other TUNIC players will either appear as that item directly (if in a freestanding location) or in a
chest with the original chest texture for that item.

Items belonging to non-TUNIC players will either appear as a question-mark block (if in a freestanding location) or in a chest with
a question mark symbol on it. Additionally, non-TUNIC items are color-coded by classification, with green for filler, blue for useful, and gold for progression.
