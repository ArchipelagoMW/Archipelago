# TUNIC

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a config file.

## I haven't played TUNIC before.

**Play vanilla first.** It is **_heavily discouraged_** to play this randomizer before playing the vanilla game.
It is recommended that you achieve both endings in the vanilla game before playing the randomizer.

## What does randomization do to this game?

In the TUNIC Randomizer, every item in the game is randomized. All chests, key item pickups, instruction manual pages, hero relics,
and other unique items are shuffled.<br>

Ability shuffling is an option available from the options page to shuffle certain abilities (prayer, holy cross, and the ice rod combo),
preventing them from being used until they are unlocked.<br>

Enemy randomization and other options are also available and can be turned on in the client mod.

## What is the goal of TUNIC when randomized?
The standard goal is the same as the vanilla game, which is to find the three hexagon keys, at which point you may either Take Your
Rightful Place or seek another path and Share Your Wisdom.

Alternatively, Hexagon Quest is a mode that shuffles a certain number of Gold Questagons into the item pool, with the goal 
being to find the required amount of them and then Share Your Wisdom.

## What items from TUNIC can appear in another player's world?
Every item has a chance to appear in another player's world.

## How many checks are in TUNIC?
There are 302 checks located across the world of TUNIC.

## What do items from other worlds look like in TUNIC?
Items belonging to other TUNIC players will either appear as that item directly (if in a freestanding location) or in a
chest with the original chest texture for that item.

Items belonging to non-TUNIC players will either appear as a question-mark block (if in a freestanding location) or in a chest with
a question mark symbol on it. Additionally, non-TUNIC items are color-coded by classification, with green for filler, blue for useful, and gold for progression.

## Is there a tracker pack?
There is a [tracker pack](https://github.com/SapphireSapphic/TunicTracker/releases/latest). It is compatible with both Poptracker and Emotracker. Using Poptracker, it will automatically track checked locations and important items received. It can also automatically tab between maps as you traverse the world. This tracker was originally created by SapphireSapphic and ScoutJD, and has been extensively updated by Br00ty.

There is also a [standalone item tracker](https://github.com/radicoon/tunic-rando-tracker/releases/latest), which tracks what items you have received. It is great for adding an item overlay to streaming setups. This item tracker was created by Radicoon.

## What should I know regarding logic?
- Nighttime is not considered in logic. Every check in the game is obtainable during the day.
- The Cathedral is accessible during the day by using the Hero's Laurels to reach the Overworld fuse near the Swamp entrance.
- The Secret Legend chest at the Cathedral can be obtained during the day by opening the Holy Cross door from the outside.

For Entrance Rando specifically:
- Activating a fuse to turn on a yellow teleporter pad also activates its counterpart in the Far Shore.
- The West Garden fuse can be activated from below.
- You can pray at the tree at the exterior of the Library.
- The elevators in the Rooted Ziggurat only go down.
- The portal in the trophy room of the Old House is active from the start.
- The elevator in Cathedral is immediately usable without activating the fuse. Activating the fuse does nothing.

## What item groups are there?
Bombs, consumables (non-bomb ones), weapons, melee weapons (stick and sword), keys, hexagons, offerings, hero relics, cards, golden treasures, money, pages, and abilities (the three ability pages). There are also a few groups being used for singular items: laurels, orb, dagger, magic rod, holy cross, prayer, ice rod, and progressive sword.

## What location groups are there?
Holy cross (for all holy cross checks), fairies (for the two fairy checks), well (for the coin well checks), and shop. Additionally, for checks that do not fall into the above categories, the name of the region is the name of the location group.
