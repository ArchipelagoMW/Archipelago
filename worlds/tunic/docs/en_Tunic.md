# TUNIC

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

In the TUNIC Randomizer, every item in the game is randomized. All chests, key item pickups, instruction manual pages, hero relics,
and other unique items are shuffled.<br>

Ability shuffling is an option available from the settings page to shuffle certain abilities (prayer, holy cross, and the ice rod combo),
preventing them from being used until they are unlocked.<br>

Enemy randomization is also available and can be turned on in the client mod.

## What is the goal of TUNIC when randomized?
The standard goal is the same as the vanilla game, which is to find the three hexagon keys, at which point you may either Take Your
Rightful Place or seek another path and Share Your Wisdom.

Alternatively, Hexagon Quest is a mode that shuffles 30 Golden Hexagons into the item pool, with the goal 
being to find 20 of them and then Share Your Wisdom.
