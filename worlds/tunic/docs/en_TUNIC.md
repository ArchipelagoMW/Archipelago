# TUNIC

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

In the TUNIC Randomizer, every item in the game is randomized. All chests, item pickups, instruction manual pages, hero relics,
consumables - everything gets shuffled.

Ability shuffling is an optional mode that further randomizes things in the game, locking away certain abilities such as 
prayer and holy cross until the corresponding manual page is found.

## What is the goal of TUNIC when randomized?
The goal is the same as the vanilla game, which is to find the three hexagon keys, at which point you may either Take Your
Rightful Place or continue searching for the opportunity to Share Your Wisdom.

Alternatively, Hexagon Quest is a different goal that shuffles 30 Golden Hexagons into the item pool, with the requirement 
being to find 20 of them in order to end the game.

## What items from TUNIC can appear in another player's world?
Every item has a chance to appear in another player's world.

## How many checks are in TUNIC?
There are 302 checks located across the world of TUNIC.

## What do items from other worlds look like in TUNIC?
Chests containing items that belong to other players will appear as the default chest texture, and freestanding items
belonging to other players will appear as golden ? blocks.
