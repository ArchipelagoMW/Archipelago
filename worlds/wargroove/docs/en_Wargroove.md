# Wargroove (Steam, Windows)

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

This randomizer shuffles units, map events, factions and boosts. It features a custom, non-linear campaign where the 
final level and 3 branching paths are all available to the player from the start. The player cannot beat the final level 
without specific items scattered throughout the branching paths. Certain levels on these paths may require 
specific units or items in order to progress.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

1. Every buildable unit in the game (except for soldiers and dogs, which are free).
2. Commanders available to certain factions. If the player acquires the Floran Commanders, they can select any commander
from that faction.
3. Income and Commander Defense boosts that provide the player with extra income or extra commander defense.
4. Special map events like the Eastern Bridges or the Southern Walls, which unlock certain locations in certain levels.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any of the above items can be in another player's world.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

When the player receives an item, a message will appear in Wargroove with the item name and sender name, once an action
is taken in game.

## What is the goal of this game when randomized?

The goal is to beat the level titled `The End` by finding the `Final Bridges`, `Final Walls`, and `Final Sickle`.
