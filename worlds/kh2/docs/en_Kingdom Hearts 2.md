# Kingdom Hearts 2

<h2 style="text-transform:none";>Changes from the vanilla game</h2>

This randomizer takes Kingdom Hearts 2 and randomizes the locations of the items for a more dynamic play experience. The items that randomize currently are all items within Chests, Popups, Get Bonuses, Form Levels, and Sora's Levels. This allows abilities that Sora would normally have to also be placed on Keyblades with random stats. With several options on ways to finish the game.

<h2 style="text-transform:none";>Where is the settings page</h2>

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a config file.


<h2 style="text-transform:none";>What is randomized in this game?</h2>


The Chests, Popups, Get Bonuses, Form Levels, and Sora's Levels.

<h2 style="text-transform:none";>What Kingdom Hearts 2 items can appear in other players' worlds?</h2>


Every item in the game with the exception being party members' abilities.

<h2 style="text-transform:none";>What is The Garden of Assemblage "GoA"?</h2>


The Garden of Assemblage Mod made by Sonicshadowsilver2 and Num turns the Garden of Assemblage into a “World Hub” where each portal takes you to one of the game worlds (as opposed to having a world map). This allows you to enter worlds at any time, and world progression is maintained for each world individually.

<h2 style="text-transform:none";>What does another world's item look like in Kingdom Hearts 2?</h2>


In Kingdom Hearts 2, items which need to be sent to other worlds appear in any location that has a item in the vanilla game. They are represented by the Archipelago icon, and must be "picked up" as if it were a normal item. Upon obtaining the item, it will be sent to its home world.

<h2 style="text-transform:none";>When the player receives an item, what happens?</h2>


It is added to your inventory. If you obtain magic, you will need to pause your game to have it show up in your inventory, then enter a new room for it to become properly usable.

<h2 style="text-transform:none";>What Happens if I die before Room Saving?</h2>


When you die in Kingdom Hearts 2, you are reverted to the last non-boss room you entered and your status is reverted to what it was at that time. However, in archipelago, any item that you have sent/received will not be taken away from the player, any chest you have opened will remain open, and you will keep your level but lose the expereince. Unlike vanilla Kingdom Hearts 2.


For example, if you are fighting Roxas and you receive Reflect Element and you die fighting Roxas, you will keep that reflect. You will still need to pause your game to have it show up in your inventory, then enter a new room for it to become properly usable.
