# Kingdom Hearts 2

<h2 style="text-transform:none";>Changes from the vanilla game</h2>

This randomizer takes Kingdom Hearts 2 and randomizes the locations of the items for a more dynamic play experience. The items that randomize currently are all items within Chests, Popups, Get Bonuses, Form Levels, and Sora's Levels. This allows abilities that Sora would normally have to also be placed on Keyblades with random stats. With several options on ways to finish the game.

<h2 style="text-transform:none";>Where is the settings page</h2>

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a config file.


<h2 style="text-transform:none";>What is randomized in this game?</h2>


The Chests, Popups, Get Bonuses, Form Levels, and Sora's Levels.

<h2 style="text-transform:none";>What Kingdom Hearts 2 items can appear in other players' worlds?</h2>


Every item in the game with the exception being party members' abilities.

<h2 style="text-transform:none";>What is The Garden of Assemblage "GoA"?</h2>


The Garden of Assemblage Mod made by Sonicshadowsilver2 and Num turns the Garden of Assemblage into a “World Hub” where each portal takes you to one of the game worlds (as opposed to having a world map). This allows you to enter worlds at any time, and world progression is maintained for each world individually.

<h2 style="text-transform:none";>What does another world's item look like in Kingdom Hearts 2?</h2>


In Kingdom Hearts 2, items which need to be sent to other worlds appear in any location that has a item in the vanilla game. They are represented by the Archipelago icon, and must be "picked up" as if it were a normal item. Upon obtaining the item, it will be sent to its home world.

<h2 style="text-transform:none";>When the player receives an item, what happens?</h2>


It is added to your inventory. If you obtain magic, you will need to pause your game to have it show up in your inventory, then enter a new room for it to become properly usable.

<h2 style="text-transform:none";>What Happens if I die before Room Saving?</h2>


When you die in Kingdom Hearts 2, you are reverted to the last non-boss room you entered and your status is reverted to what it was at that time. However, in archipelago, any item that you have sent/received will not be taken away from the player, unlike vanilla Kingdom Hearts 2.


For example, if you are fighting Roxas and you receive Reflect Element and you die fighting Roxas, you will keep that reflect. You will still need to pause your game to have it show up in your inventory, then enter a new room for it to become properly usable.

<h2 style="text-transform:none";>Recommendation</h2>

- Recommended making a save at the start of the GoA before opening anything. This will be the recommended file to load if/when your game crashes.
    - If you don't want to have a save in the GoA. Disconnect the client, load the auto save, and then reconnect the client after it loads the auto save.
- Recommended to set fps limit to 60fps.
- Recommended to run the game in windows/borderless windowed mode. Fullscreen is stable but the game can crash if you alt-tab out.
- Recommend viewing [Requirements/logic sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Embae0t7pIrbzvX-NRywk7bTHHEvuFzzQBUUpSUL7Ak/edit?usp=sharing)

<h2 style="text-transform:none";>F.A.Q.</h2>

- Why am I not getting magic?
    - If you obtain magic, you will need to pause your game to have it show up in your inventory, then enter a new room for it to become properly usable.
- Why am I missing worlds/portals in the GoA?
    - You are missing the required visit locking item to access the world/portal.
- What versions of Kingdom Hearts 2 are supported?
    - Currently `only` the most up to date version on the Epic Game Store is supported `1.0.0.8_WW`. Emulator may be added in the future.
- Why did I crash?
    - The port of Kingdom Hearts 2 can and will randomly crash, this is the fault of the game not the randomizer or the archipelago client.
      - If you have a continuous/constant crash (in the same area/event every time) you will want to reverify your installed files. This can be done by doing the following: Open Epic Game Store --> Library --> Click Triple Dots --> Manage --> Verify
- Why am I getting dummy items or letters?
    - You will need to get the `JaredWeakStrike/APCompanion` (you can find how to get this in the setup guide)
- Why am I not sending or receiving items?
    - Make sure you are connected to the KH2 client and the correct room (for more information reference the setup guide)
- Why did I not load in to the correct visit
    - You need to trigger a cutscene or visit The World That Never Was for it to update you have recevied the item.
- Why should I install the auto save mod at `KH2FM-Mods-equations19/auto-save`?
    - Because Kingdom Hearts 2 is prone to crashes and will keep you from losing your progress.
- How do I load an auto save?
    - To load an auto-save, hold down the Select or your equivalent on your prefered controller while choosing a file. Make sure to hold the button down the whole time.
- How do I do a soft reset?
    - Hold L1+L2+R1+R2+Start or your equivalent on your prefered controller at the same time to immediately reset the game to the start screen.
