## What is The Garden of Assemblage?

the Garden of Assemblage mod made by SonicShadowSilver2 and Num turns the Garden of Assemblage into a “world hub” where each

This allows you to enter worlds at any time, and world progression 
is maintained for each world individually.

## What does another world's item look like in Kingdom Hearts 2?

In Kingdom Hearts 2, items which need to be sent to other worlds appear in any location that has a Item in Vanilla. They are
represented by the Archipelago icon, and must be "picked up" as if it were a normal item. Upon obtaining
the item will be sent to its home world.
