# Kingdom Hearts 2 Archipelago Setup Guide

## Generating a game

### What is a YAML?

YAML is the file format which Archipelago uses in order to configure a player's world. It allows you to dictate which
game you will be playing as well as the settings you would like for that game.

YAML is a format very similar to JSON however it is made to be more human-readable. If you are ever unsure of the
validity of your YAML file you may check the file by uploading it to the check page on the Archipelago website. Check
page: [YAML Validation Page](/mysterycheck)

### Creating a YAML

YAML files may be generated on the Archipelago website by visiting the games page and clicking the "Settings Page" link
under any game. Clicking "Export Settings" in a game's settings page will download the YAML to your system. Games
page: [Archipelago Games List](/games)

In a multiworld there must be one YAML per world. Any number of players can play on each world using either the game's
native coop system or using Archipelago's coop support. Each world will hold one slot in the multiworld and will have a
slot name and, if the relevant game requires it, files to associate it with that multiworld.

If multiple people plan to play in one world cooperatively then they will only need one YAML for their coop world. If
each player is planning on playing their own game then they will each need a YAML.
