# Gauntlet Legends

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and
export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Items which the player would normally acquire throughout the game have been moved around. Logic remains, so the game is
always able to be completed, but because of the item shuffle, the player may need to access certain areas before they
would in the vanilla game.

## What is the goal of Gauntlet Legends when randomized?

Defeat Skorne in the Underworld. This requires gathering all 13 Runestones to gain access to the Underworld, and being strong enough to beat Skorne.

Along the way, players will need to activate Obelisks to unlock new areas for them to explore.
They may also need to collect Mirror Shards, which will unlock a 5th area to explore as well as the Cathedral level.

## What items and locations can get shuffled?

Locations in which items can be found:
- All in-stage items
- All Chests
- All Barrels
- All Runestones
- All Obelisks
- All Mirror Shards

Items that can be placed into locations:
- Keys
- Potions
- All consumable items
- Runestones
- Obelisks
- Mirror Shards
- Death

## What does another world's item look like in Gauntlet Legends?

Items will show up as a purple coin, both as items and in chests or barrels.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

Items will be placed directly into the players inventory.
If the player either leaves a stage midway or dies, the items they received mid-level will be given back to them in the lobby.
