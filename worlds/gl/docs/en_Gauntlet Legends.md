# Gauntlet Legends

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and
export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Items which the player would normally acquire throughout the game have been moved around. Logic remains, so the game is
always able to be completed, but because of the item shuffle, the player may need to access certain areas before they
would in the vanilla game.

The game has been changed to an open-world style as opposed to the linear style the vanilla game has.

Other Features such as Turbo through textboxes (Hold L/R+A) and Pipe Warping from any room (Hold L+R+SELECT) have been added for convenience.

Enemies and Bosses can be randomized, and their stats can be scaled to feel more like the vanilla game's stats.

Other aspects of the game can be randomized as well such as music, sounds, battle backgrounds, Mario and Luigi's Colors, and more.

## What is the goal of Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga when randomized?

Defeat Cackletta's Soul in Bowser's Castle. This requires you to collect all 4 Beanstar Pieces, restore the Beanstar, and bring Peach's Extra Dress and the Fake Beanstar to Fawful at the end of Jokes End. 

In total, this requires:
- 4 Beanstar Pieces
- Peach's Extra Dress
- Fake Beanstar
- Ultra Hammers
- Fire Hand
- Thunder Hand

## What does another world's item look like in Gauntlet Legends?

Items will show up as a purple coin, both as items and in chests or barrels.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

Items will be placed directly into the players inventory.
If the player either leaves a stage midway or dies, the items they received mid-level will be given back to them in the lobby.
