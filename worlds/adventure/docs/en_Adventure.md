# Adventure

## Where is the settings page?
The [player settings page for Adventure](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?
Adventure items may be distributed into additional locations not possible in the vanilla Adventure randomizer.  All Adventure items are added to the multiworld item pool.  Additional checks may be enabled in the options. 

## What is the goal of Adventure when randomized?
Find the Enchanted Chalice and return it to the Yellow Castle

## Which items can be in another player's world?
All three keys, the chalice, the sword, the magnet, and the bridge can be found in another player's world

## What is considered a location check in Adventure?
Most rooms have one or two regions which can contain an Adventure item or an Archipelago item.  If the region contains a 'nothing' Adventure item, it will send a check when that is seen.  If it contains an item from another Adventure or other game, it will show a rough approximation of the Archipelago logo that can be touched for a check.

## Which notable items are not randomized?
The dragons and the bat are not yet randomized, nor is the map

## What does another world's item look like in Adventure?
It looks vaguely like a flashing Archipelago logo. 

## When the player receives an item, what happens?
A message is shown in the client log.  While empty handed, the player can press the fire button to retrieve items in the order they were received.
