# Blasphemous

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

All items that appear on the ground are randomized, and there are options to randomize more of the game, such as stat upgrades, enemies, skills, and more.

In addition, there are other changes to the game that make it better optimized for a randomizer:

- Some items and enemies are never randomized.
- Teleportation between Prie Dieus can be unlocked from the beginning.
- New save files are created in True Torment mode (NG+), but enemies and bosses will use their regular attack & defense values. A penitence can be chosen if the option is enabled.
- Save files can not be ascended - the randomizer is meant to be completed in a single playthrough.
- The Ossuary will give a reward for every four bones collected.
- Side quests have been modified so that the items received from them cannot be missed.
- The Apodictic Heart of Mea Culpa can be unequipped.
- Dying with the Immaculate Bead is unnecessary, it is automatically upgraded to the Weight of True Guilt.
- If the option is enabled, the 34 corpses in game will have their messages changed to give hints about certain items and locations. The Shroud of Dreamt Sins is not required to hear them.

## What has been changed about the side quests?

Tirso: 
- Tirso's helpers will never die. Herbs can be given to him at any time.

Gemino: 
- Gemino will never freeze. The thimble can be given to him at any time.

Viridiana: 
- Viridiana will never die. The player can ask for her assistance at all 5 boss fights, and she will still appear at the rooftops.

Redento: 
- No changes.

Cleofas: 
- The choice to end Socorro's suffering has been removed. 
- Cleofas will not jump off the rooftops, even after talking to him without the Cord of the True Burying.

Crisanta / Ending C: 
- The Incomplete Scapular will not skip the fight with Esdras. Instead, it is required to open the door to the church in Brotherhood of the Silent Sorrow.
- Perpetva's item from The Resting Place of the Sister is always accessible, even after defeating Esdras.
- Crisanta's gift in Brotherhood of the Silent Sorrow will always be the Holy Wound of Abnegation.
- When fighting Crisanta, it is no longer required to have the Apodictic Heart of Mea Culpa equipped to continue with Ending C, it just needs to be in the player's inventory.

## Which items and enemies are never randomized?

Items:
- Golden Thimble Filled with Burning Oil - from the fountain of burning oil in Convent of Our Lady of the Charred Visage
- Hatched Egg of Deformity - from the tree in Mountains of the Endless Dusk
- Chalice of Inverted Verses - from the statue in Desecrated Cistern
- Holy Wound of Abnegation - given by Crisanta in Brotherhood of the Silent Sorrow

Enemies:
- The Charging Knell in Mountains of the Endless Dusk
- The bell ringer in lower east Jondo
- The first Phalaris, Lionheart, and Sleepless Tomb in their respective areas (Chalice of Inverted Verses quest)

In addition, any enemies that appear in some kind of arena (such as the Confessor Dungeons, or the bridges in Archcathedral Rooftops or Grievance Ascends) will not be randomized to prevent softlocking.

## What does another world's item look like in Blasphemous?

Items retain their original appearance. You won't know if an item is for another player until you collect it. The only exception to this is the shops, where items that belong to other players are represented by the Archipelago logo.
