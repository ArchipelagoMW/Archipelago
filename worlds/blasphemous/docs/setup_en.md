# Blasphemous Multiworld Setup Guide

## Required Software

- Blasphemous from: [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/774361/Blasphemous/)

## Instructions (Windows)

1. Download the [Modding API](https://github.com/BrandenEK/Blasphemous-Modding-API/releases), and follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/BrandenEK/Blasphemous-Modding-API#installation) on the GitHub page.

2. After the Modding API has been installed, download the [Randomizer](https://github.com/BrandenEK/Blasphemous-Randomizer/releases) and [Multiworld](https://github.com/BrandenEK/Blasphemous-Multiworld/releases) archives, and extract the contents of both into the `Modding` folder.

3. Start Blasphemous. To verfy that the mods are working, look for a version number for both the Randomizer and Multiworld on the title screen.

## Connecting

To connect to an Archipelago server, open the in-game console by pressing backslash `\` and use the command `multiworld connect [address:port] [name] [password]`. The port and password are both optional - if no port is provided then the default port of 38281 is used.
**Make sure to connect to the server before attempting to start a new save file.**
