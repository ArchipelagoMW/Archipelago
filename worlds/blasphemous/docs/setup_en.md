# Blasphemous Multiworld Setup Guide

It is recommended to use the [Mod Installer](https://github.com/BrandenEK/Blasphemous.Modding.Installer) to handle installing and updating mods. If you would prefer to install mods manually, instructions can also be found at the Mod Installer repository. 

You will need the [Multiworld](https://github.com/BrandenEK/Blasphemous.Randomizer.Multiworld) mod to play an Archipelago randomizer.

Some optional mods are also recommended:
- [Rando Map](https://github.com/BrandenEK/Blasphemous.Randomizer.MapTracker)
- [Boots of Pleading](https://github.com/BrandenEK/Blasphemous.BootsOfPleading) (Required if the "Boots of Pleading" option is enabled)
- [Double Jump](https://github.com/BrandenEK/Blasphemous.DoubleJump) (Required if the "Purified Hand of the Nun" option is enabled)

To connect to a multiworld: Choose a save file and enter the address, your name, and the password (if the server has one) into the menu.

After connecting, there are some commands you can use in the console, which can be opened by pressing backslash `\`:
- `ap status` - Display connection status.
- `ap say [message]` - Send a message to the server.
- `ap hint [item]` - Request a hint for an item from the server.
