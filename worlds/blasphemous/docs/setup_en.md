# Blasphemous Multiworld Setup Guide

## Required Software

- Blasphemous from: [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/774361/Blasphemous/)
- Damocles03's Item and Enemy Randomizer from: [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/blasphemous/mods/15)
- Blasphemous Multiworld from: [GitHub](https://github.com/BrandenEK/Blasphemous-Multiworld)

## Instructions (Windows)

1. Download the Randomizer from the [Files](https://www.nexusmods.com/blasphemous/mods/15?tab=files) page, and the Multiworld from the [Releases](https://github.com/BrandenEK/Blasphemous-Multiworld/releases) page. Extract the contents of the Randomizer archive into your Blasphemous root folder, then do the same with the Multiworld archive. 
When asked, replace all files in the destination folders.

2. Start Blasphemous. To verify that the mod is working, look for a version number for both the Randomizer and Multiworld on the title screen.

## Connecting

To connect to an Archipelago server, open the in-game console by pressing backslash `\` and use the command `connect [address:port] [name] [password]`. The port and password are both optional - if no port is provided then the default port of 38281 is used.
**Make sure to connect to the server before attempting to start a new save file.**
