# Blasphemous Multiworld Setup Guide

## Required Software

- Blasphemous from: [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/774361/Blasphemous/)
- BepInEx from: [GitHub](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases)
- Damocles03's Item and Enemy Randomizer from: [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/blasphemous/mods/15)

## Instructions (Windows)

1. Download and install BepInEx 5 (64-bit, version 5.4.21 or newer) to your Blasphemous root folder. *Do not use any pre-release versions of BepInEx 6.*

2. Start Blasphemous once so that BepInEx can create its required configuration files.

3. Download the Randomizer and Multiworld from the [Files](https://www.nexusmods.com/blasphemous/mods/15?tab=files) page. First, extract the contents of the Randomizer archive into your Blasphemous root folder, then do the same with the Multiworld archive. When asked, replace all files in the destination folders.

4. Start Blasphemous again. To verify that the mod is working, look for a version number for both the Randomizer and Multiworld on the title screen.

## Connecting

To connect to an Archipelago server, open the in-game console by pressing backslash `\` and use the command `connect [address:port] [name] [password]`. The port and password are both optional - if no port is provided then the default port of 38281 is used.
**Make sure to connect to the server before attempting to start a new save file.**
