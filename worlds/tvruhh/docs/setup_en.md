# TVRUHH Randomizer Setup Guide

### Required Software

- [Archipelago](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases/latest)
- A Steam copy of [The Void Rains Upon Her Heart](https://store.steampowered.com/app/790060/The_Void_Rains_Upon_Her_Heart/)
- The TVRUHH Archipelago Mod
- The [TVRUHH APWorld](about:blank)

### How to play

First, you will need a room to connect to. This is not explained here, but you should check the [Archipelago Setup Guide](/tutorial/Archipelago/setup_en#generating-a-game) for that.

You will also need to have [Archipelago]() installed into your computer, [the TVRUHH APWorld]() installed into Archipelago and the TVRUHH Archipelago Mod into TVRUHH.

You will now need to open the TVRUHH Client, which should be available from the Archipelago launcher once you have successfully installed the APWorld.

Once you connected to the Multiworld, open the game and it should automatically connect to the client.
