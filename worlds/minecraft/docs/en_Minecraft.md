# Minecraft

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Some recipes are locked from being able to be crafted and shuffled into the item pool. It can also optionally change which
structures appear in each dimension. Crafting recipes are re-learned when they are received from other players as item
checks, and occasionally when completing your own achievements. See below for which recipes are shuffled.

## What is considered a location check in Minecraft?

Location checks are completed when the player completes various Minecraft achievements. Opening the advancements menu
in-game by pressing "L" will display outstanding achievements.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

When the player receives an item in Minecraft, it either unlocks crafting recipes or puts items into the player's
inventory directly.

## What is the victory condition?

Victory is achieved when the player kills the Ender Dragon, enters the portal in The End, and completes the credits
sequence either by skipping it or watching it play out.
