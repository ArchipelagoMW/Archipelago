## How Does Randomizer Work in the Kitchen?

The *Overcooked! 2* Randomizer completely transforms the game into a metroidvania with items and item locations. Many of the Chefs' inherent abilities have been temporarily removed such that your scoring potential is limited at the start of the game. The more your inventory grows, the easier it will be to earn 2 and 3 Stars on each level.

The game takes place entirely in the "Story" campaign on a fresh save file. The ultimate goal is to reach and complete level 6-6. In order to do this you must regain enough of your abilities to complete all levels in World 6 and obtain enough stars to purchase 6-6*.

Randomizer can be played alone (one player switches between controlling two chefs) or up to 4 local/online friends. Player count can be changed at any time during the Archipelago game.

**Note: 6-6 is excluded from "Shuffle Level Order", so it will always be the standard final boss stage.*

## Items

The first time a level is completed, a random item is given to the chef(s). If playing in a MultiWorld, completing a level may instead give another Archipelago user their item. The item found is displayed as text at the top of the results screen.

Once all items have been obtained, the game will play like the original experience.

The following items were invented for Randomizer:

### Player Abilities
- Dash/Dash Cooldown
