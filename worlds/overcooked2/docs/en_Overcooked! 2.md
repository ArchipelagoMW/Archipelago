## How Does Randomizer Work in a Kitchen?

The Overcooked! 2 randomizer goes to the effort of making overcooked into a (somewhat linear) metroidvania complete with items and item locations. Many of the Chefs' inherent abilities have been itemized so that your scoring potential is very limited at the start of the game. The more your inventory grows, the easier it will be to earn 2 and 3-stars on each level. In addition to these added progression items, the randomizer modifies the following:

- Tutorial is skipped
- Shuffle Level Order: Replaces each level on the overworld with a random level from Story or any of the DLCs
- You can now play each of the 6 worlds in any order
- The unlock requirements for Kevin Levels have been itemized/randomized
- Stars required to unlock level(s) have been rebalanced
- Points required to earn stars have been rebalanced. They are based off of the curent World Record on the game's [Leaderboard](https://overcooked.greeny.dev)
- Many bugfixes present in the base game (including "Sink Bug" and "Double Serving") are patched out
- All chef avatars are unlocked at the start of a new save file
- Significantly reduced the time alloted to beat 6-6 so that it's not a cakewalk

## What is the goal?

*Overcooked! 2 Randomizer* is played entirely in the "Story" campaign. The ultimate goal is to unlock level 6-6 and complete it once. In order to do this, you will need enough stars to reach 6-6, beat all the previous levels in world 6, and have enough items to complete 6-6 in the allotted time period.
