## How Does Randomizer Work in the Kitchen?

The *Overcooked! 2* Randomizer completely transforms the game into a metroidvania with items and item locations. Many of the Chefs' inherent abilities have been temporarily removed such that your scoring potential is limited at the start of the game. The more your inventory grows, the easier it will be to earn 2 and 3 Stars on each level.

The game takes place entirely in the "Story" campaign on a fresh save file. The ultimate goal is to reach level 6-6 and complete it once. In order to do this, you must first complete all the previous levels in World 6, collect enough stars to purchase 6-6, and have regained enough of the chef's abilities to successfully complete the level.

**Note: 6-6 is excluded from "Shuffle Level Order", so it will always be the standard final boss stage.*

## Items

These items were invented for Randomizer. The first time a level is completed, a random item is granted. If playing in a MultiWorld, completing a level may instead grant one of your teammate's items. The item found is displayed as text at the top of the results screen. The idea is that the game plays like the orginal experince once all items have been obtained.
