## What does randomization do to this game?

The Overcooked! 2 randomizer goes to the effort of making this game a metroidvania just so that there can be items which may be shuffled. Many of the Chefs' inherent abilities have been itemized such that your capabilities are very limited at the start of the game. The more abilities you unlock, the easier it will be to earn 2 and 3-stars on each level. In addition to these added progression items, the randomizer modifies the following:

- Tutorial is skipped
- Levels Order is randomized, including levels from DLC packs
- You can now play each of the 6 worlds in any order you want to make things more interesting
- The unlock requirements for Kevin Levels have been itemized/randomized
- Stars required to unlock level(s) have been rebalanced
- Points required to earn stars have been rebalanced. They are based off of the curent World Record on the game's [Leaderboard](https://overcooked.greeny.dev)
- Many bugfixes present in the base game (including "Sink Bug" and "Double Serving") are patched out
- All chef avatars are unlocked at the start of a new save file
- Significantly reduced the time alloted to beat 6-6 so that it's not a cakewalk

## What is the goal?

To unlock level 6-6 and complete it once.

## What Overcooked! 2 items can appear in other players' worlds?

All of the newly fabricated items.

## What does another world's item look like in Overcooked! 2?
