# Overcooked! 2 Randomizer Setup Guide

## Required Software

- [Overcooked! 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/728880/Overcooked_2/) for PC

## General Concept

OC2Modding is a general purpose modding framework which also acts as an Archipelago network client. It works by using Harmony to inject custom code into the game at runtime, so none of the game files are modified in any way.

## Installation Procedures

### Install OC2Modding

1. Download extrac the contents of the latest [OC2-Modding Release](https://github.com/toasterparty/oc2-modding/releases)

2. Double-Click `oc2-modding-install.bat` follow the instructions

## Auto-Complete

Since the goal of randomizer isn't to achieve new high scores players may find themselves waiting for a level timer to expire. A new option has been added to automatically complete levels once a target star count has been achieved.

To enable Auto-Complete, press the `"Show"` button near the top of your screen to expand the modding controls. Then, press the "`Auto-Complete <x>`" button until it shows the desired setting.

## Where do I get a config file?

The [Player Settings](www.example.com) page on the website allows you to
configure your personal settings and export them into a config file.
