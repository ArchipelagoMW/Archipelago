## Required Software

- [Overcooked! 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/728880/Overcooked_2/)
- [OC2Modding Client](https://github.com/toasterparty/oc2-modding/releases)

## General Concept

OC2Modding is a general purpose modding framework which also acts as an Archipelago network client. It works by using Harmony to inject custom code into the game at runtime, so none of the game files are modified in any way.

On startup, the modding framework scans the game file directory for a file named `OC2Modding.json` and loads the seed information from it. If this happens, the game will use a custom save directory unique to the MultiWorld seed and will act as if it were the first time playing the game. To return to your old save data, simply delete `OC2Modding.json` when you are done playing Archipelago.
