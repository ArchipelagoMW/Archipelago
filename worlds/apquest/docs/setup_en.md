# APQuest Randomizer Setup Guide

## Required Software

- [Archipelago](github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases/latest)
- [The APQuest apworld](https://github.com/NewSoupVi/Archipelago/releases), 
  if not bundled with your version of Archipelago

## How to play

First, you need a room to connect to. For this, you or someone you know has to generate a game.  
This will not be explained here,
but you can check the [Archipelago Setup Guide](https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/setup_en#generating-a-game).

You also need to have [Archipelago](github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases/latest) installed
and the [The APQuest apworld](https://github.com/NewSoupVi/Archipelago/releases) installed into Archipelago.

From here, connecting to your APQuest slot is easy. There are two scenarios.

### Webhost Room

If your room is hosted on a WebHost (e.g. [archipelago.gg](archipelago.gg)),
you should be able to simply click on your name in the player list.  
This will open the Archipelago Launcher
and ask you whether you want to connect with the Text Client or the APQuest Client.  
Choose "APQuest Client". The rest should happen completely automatically and you should be able to play APQuest.

### Locally hosted room

If your room does not have a WebHost room page available, you can launch APQuest manually.  

Open the Archipelago Launcher, and then select the APQuest Client from the list.  
After a short while, the APQuest client should open.  
Enter the server address at the top and click "Connect".  
Then, enter your name. If a password exists, enter the password.  
You should now be connected and able to play APQuest.

## Switching Rooms

The APQuest Client can seamlessly switch rooms without restarting.

Simply click the "Disconnect" button, then connect to a different slot/room.

## Music / Volume

The APQuest Client currently has no in-built volume slider,
but you can use your operating system's sound mixer to adjust the volume.
