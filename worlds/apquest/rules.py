    # A CollectionState describes the current progress of the players in the multiworld, i.e. what items they have,
    # which regions they've reached, etc.
    # In an access rule, we can ask whether the player has a collected a certain item.
    # We can do this via the state.has(...) function.
    # This function takes an item name, a player number, and an optional count parameter (more on that below)
    # Since a rule only takes a CollectionState parameter, but we also need the player number in the state.has call,
    # our function needs to be locally defined so that it has access to the player number from the outer scope.

    # reach the region that the chest sits in.
    # However, our two enemies work differently.
    # Entering the room with the enemy is not enough, you also need to have enough combat items to be able to defeat it.
    # So, we need to set requirements on the Locations themselves.
    # Since combat is a bit more complicated, we'll use this chance to cover some advanced access rule concepts.

    # Now, what's actually wrong with this? It works perfectly fine, right?
    # If hard mode disabled, Sword is enough. If hard mode is enabled, we also need a Shield or a Health Upgrade.
    # The access rule we just wrote does this correctly, so what's the problem?
    # The problem is performance.
    # Most of your world code doesn't need to be perfectly performant, since it just runs once per slot.
    # However, access rules in particular are by far the hottest code path in Archipelago.
    # An access rule will potentially be called thousands or even millions of times over the course of one generation.
    # As a result, access rules are the one place where it's really worth putting in some effort to optimize.
    # What's the performance problem here?
    # Every time our access rule is called, it has to evaluate whether world.options.hard_mode is True or False.
    # Wouldn't it be better if in easy mode, the access rule only checked for Sword to begin with?
    # Wouldn't it also be better if in hard mode, it already knew it had to check Shield and Health Upgrade as well?
    # Well, we can achieve this by doing the "if world.options.hard_mode" check outside the set_rule call,
    # and instead having two *different* set_rule calls depending on which case we're in.
