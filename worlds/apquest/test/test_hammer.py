        # This unit test genuinely found an error in the world code when it was first written!
        # The Hammer logic was not actually being correctly applied even if the hammer option was enabled,
        # and the generator thought Top Middle Chest was considered accessible without the Hammer.
        # This is why testing can be extremely valuable.
