# It holds all the data and functions required to build the world and submit it to the multiworld generator.
# You could have all your world code in just this one class, but for readability and better structure,
# it is common to split up world functionality into multiple files.
# This implementation in particular has the following additional files, each covering one topic:
# regions.py, locations.py, rules.py, items.py, options.py and web_world.py.
# It is recommended that you read these in that specific order, then come back to the world class.
