This apworld is meant as a learning tool for new apworld devs.

You'll want to start with __init__.py, then move to world.py.
If you also want to learn how to write unit tests, go to test/__init__.py.

You can ignore the apquest/ folder, it contains the actual game code, graphics and music.

The client/ folder is NOT meant for teaching.
While the client was written to the best of its author's ability, it does not meet the same standard as the world code.
The client code is also lacking the explanatory comments.
Copy from it at your own risk.
