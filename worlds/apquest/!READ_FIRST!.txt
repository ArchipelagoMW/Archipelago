This apworld is meant as a learning tool for new apworld devs.
It is a completely standalone resource, but there will be links to additional resources when appropriate.

APQuest will only explain how to write the generation-side code for your game, not how to write a client or mod for it.
For a more zoomed out view of how to add a game to Archipelago, you can read this document:
https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/blob/main/docs/adding%20games.md

APQuest assumes you already vaguely know what an apworld is.
If you don't know, read this first:
https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/blob/main/docs/apworld%20specification.md

To write an apworld, you need to be running Archipelago from source (Python) instead of using e.g. the .exe build.
Here's an explanation for how to do that.

# How to read APQuest #
#######################

You'll want to start with __init__.py, then move to world.py.
If you also want to learn how to write unit tests, go to test/__init__.py.

You can ignore the apquest/ folder, it contains the actual game code, graphics and music.

The client/ folder is NOT meant for teaching.
While the client was written to the best of its author's ability, it does not meet the same standard as the world code.
The client code is also lacking the explanatory comments.
Copy from it at your own risk.

APQuest is a very simple game, so not every edge case will be covered.
The world API document goes a lot more in-depth on certain topics:
https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/blob/main/docs/world%20api.md

There is also the "APWorld dev FAQ" document with common emergent problems:
https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/blob/main/docs/apworld_dev_faq.md

In general, but especially if you want your apworld to be verified by core, you should follow our style guide:
