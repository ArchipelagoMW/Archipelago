# Yacht Dice Randomizer Setup Guide

## Required Software

- A browser (you are probably using one right now!).
- Archipelago from the [Archipelago Releases Page](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases).

## Playing the game
Open the Yacht Dice website. There are two options:
- Download the latest release from [Yacht Dice Releases](https://github.com/spinerak/YachtDiceAP/releases) and unzip the Website.zip. Then open player.html in your browser. 
- Cruise over to the [Yacht Dice website](https://yacht-dice-ap.netlify.app/). This also works on mobile. If the website is not available, use the first option.

The website has an offline play option to try out the game without having to generate a game first.

## Play with Archipelago

- Create your yaml file via the [Yacht Dice Player Settings Page](/games/YachtDice/player-settings).
- After generating, open the Yacht Dice website. After the tutoroll, fill in the room-information. 
- After logging in, you are good to go. The website has a built-in client, where you can chat and send commands.

For more information on yaml files, generating Archipelago games and connecting to servers, please see the [Basic Multiworld Setup Guide](/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en).
