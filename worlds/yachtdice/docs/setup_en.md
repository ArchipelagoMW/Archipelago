# Yacht Dice Randomizer Setup Guide

## Required Software

- A browser (you are probably using one right now!).

## Playing the game
Open the Yacht Dice website. There are two options:
- Cruise over to the [Yacht Dice Website](https://yacht-dice-ap.netlify.app/). This is the easiest option. If the website is unavailable, use the next option.
- Download the latest release from [Yacht Dice Release](https://github.com/spinerak/ArchipelagoYachtDice/releases/latest) and unzip the Website.zip. Then open index.html in your browser.

Press Archipelago, and after logging in, you are good to go. The website has a built-in client, where you can chat and send commands.    
Both options also have a "Solo play" mode to try out the game without having to generate a game first.

For more information on generating Archipelago games and connecting to servers, please see the [Basic Multiworld Setup Guide](/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en).
