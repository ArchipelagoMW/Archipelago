## Required Software

Download the game from the [Bumper Stickers GitHub releases page](https://github.com/FelicitusNeko/FlixelBumpStik/releases).

*A web version will be made available on itch.io at a later time.*

## Installation Procedures

Simply download the latest version of Bumper Stickers from the link above, and extract it wherever you like.

- ⚠️ Do not extract Bumper Stickers to Program Files, as this will cause file access issues.

## Joining a Multiworld Game

1. Run `BumpStik.exe`.
2. Select "Archipelago Mode".
3. Enter your server details in the fields provided, and click "Start".

## Finishing the Game

Archipelago Mode differs from Classic mode in the following ways:
- The board starts as a 3×3 field, with only two colors in play.
- You'll be presented with a set of tasks to complete, on the HUD.
- Tasks may have multiple steps. If they do, you will see **[+#]** next to it, indicating how many more steps are left in this task. Each step completed sends a check.
- Completing each task will send a check. Clearing Bonus Boosters (with yellow and blue dots on the corners) and Treasure Bumpers (adorned with the AP logo) will send one check, whether or not they complete a task.
- Completing all tasks will end the board in play, and start a larger board with more colors and a new set of tasks.
- Your goal is to complete all five levels.

In addition to Paint Cans from Classic mode, two new tools are also available:
- Turners allow you to change the direction of any bumper. You won't get them from scoring, but you can get them as Archipelago items, and they'll refresh every time you start a new board.
- Task Skips allow you to skip one step in any task. They can only be obtained as Archipelago items. Make sure you keep them for when you need them most; if you use one, it won't come back!
- You can also get Starting Paint Cans from the AP server. These refresh when you start a new board.

## Commands

While playing the multiworld, you can interact with the server using various commands listed in the [commands guide](/tutorial/Archipelago/commands/en). As this game does not have an in-game text client at the moment, you can optionally connect to the multiworld using the text client, which can be found in the [main Archipelago installation](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases) as Archipelago Text Client to enter these commands.
