# Bumper Stickers

## Where is the settings page?
The [player settings page for Bumper Stickers](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?
The board starts out very small and with a limited set of colors. Getting items will expand the board and add the potential of more colors. Note that the board will only expand after you have Jammed your current board (no moves available).

## What is the goal of Bumper Stickers when randomized?
The goal is to expand the board and complete all objectives.

## Which items can be in another player's world?
 - The board can be expanded six times.
 - Available colors can be increased four times.
 - Two items will increase your starting Paint Can stock, allowing to recolor any Bumper in play.
 - Five Booster Bumpers will permanently increase your bonus multiplier.
 - Three Hazard Bumpers can show up. These are immobile, and cannot be cleared for at least five turns.

## What is considered a location check in Bumper Stickers?
 - Score thresholds of 500 points, up to 4000, will result in a check.
 - Clearing a Booster Bumper will send a check.
 - Combo clears of 4, 5, and 6 Bumpers will send checks the first time they happen.
 - Chain clears of ×2 and ×3 will send checks the first time they happen.
 - Clearing all bumpers from the board will send a check.
