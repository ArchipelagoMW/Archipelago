# Bumper Stickers

## Where is the settings page?
The [player settings page for Bumper Stickers](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?
Playing this in Archipelago is a very different experience from Classic mode. You start with a very small board and a set of tasks. Completing those tasks will give you a larger board and more, harder tasks. In addition, special types of bumpers exist that must be cleared in order to progress.

## What is the goal of Bumper Stickers when randomized?
The goal is to complete all of the tasks for all five levels.

## Which items can be in another player's world?
The main objects are:
 - Treasure Bumpers, which are worth double points and send a check.
 - Bonus Boosters, which permanently increase your score multiplier and send a check.

Some utilities are also available:
 - Paint Cans allow you to change the color of any bumper. Receiving a Starting Paint Can will give you one to use immediately, plus start you with one more when a new board starts.
 - Turners allow you to change the direction of any bumper. Receiving a Starting Turner will give you one to use immediately, plus start you with one more when a new board starts.
 - Task Skips allow you to skip one step of any level task. Careful; these do not replenish!

There are also traps, if you want to enable them:
 - Hazard Bumpers start popping up on Level 2. They cannot be cleared for five turns; after that, they remain immobile, but are colored and can be cleared, as well as painted.
 - Rainbow Traps change the color of all bumpers on the field.
 - Spinner Traps change the direction of all bumpers on the field.
 - Killer Traps end your board immediately.

The rest of checks are either score bonuses, or simply nothing.

## What is considered a location check in Bumper Stickers?
Every step of a task completed sends a check. Every Treasure Bumper and Bonus Booster will also send a check, whether or not it completes a task.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?
A notification will briefly appear at the bottom of the screen informing you of what you have received.
