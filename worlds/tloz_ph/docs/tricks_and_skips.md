# List of tricks, skips and glitches by area, marked with logic requirements and with video links when available
Thanks to the [glitches spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18NCGJjt9wil1gnRB2rZO9DIv_5etKmRf0sAH66i5SVQ/edit?usp=sharing) for collecting everything relevant to the vanilla game!

## Mercay island
- [Swordless/bombless Mountain Passage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_J14xLnVWM). Savewarping from the back entrance of Mountain Passage also works (Glitched Logic)
- [Mercay out of bounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcyfYE68LUQ). (Glitched Logic)

## TotOK
### Time Logic
Phantom hourglass time logic is now available! On easy, it calculates the time it takes to walk (no rolling) from one 
floor to the next with various items. It then calculates the time to get each location from the start of their floor, 
for various items. It does not account for golden time pots. Medium halves the logically required time, and hard 
quarters it, while beginner doubles it. The longest probable required amount of time is around 10 minutes for beginner, 
5 for easy, 2.5 for medium and 1.25 for hard. It will generate slightly more sand than necessary based on your settings.
There's also a setting for how to count hearts as time, for only requiring the phantom hourglass item or for not 
calculating logic at all! Good luck!
