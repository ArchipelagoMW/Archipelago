# FAQ and Credits for The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass for Archipelago

## What is this?
This is an Archipelago Randomizer for Zelda: Phantom Hourglass that doesn't use modding or romhacking to function. All randomization 
is done by reading and writing active memory with a lua script connected to the client. This means that item models and 
text boxes in game will look vanilla, but they will still give the correct items. The main way to tell what you actually 
got is with the client.

If you want to help make a randomizer that's fully integrated into the game, visit [ph-randomizer](https://github.com/phst-randomizer/ph-randomizer). Unaffiliated with this project, but real cool.

This is a spiritual successor to my discontinued [Manual for Phantom Hourglass](https://github.com/carrotinator/manual_phantomhourglass_carrot). It covers the full game but you've got to do all the memory editing manually.

## Who made this?
This version of the randomizer was made by me, Carrotinator. But it wouldn't have been possible without the work of many that came before. Here are some of them:
 * The Phantom Hourglass [Decomp Project](https://github.com/AetiasHax/ph), and especially: 
   * Aetias for making an inventory editing script while playing the manual rando for PH I made previously. This spawned the idea for using the generic bizhawk connector to do everything, and look where that got us
   * Everyone who worked on the [PH dev spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_4Bo1IxLDtaytXj7SQFIAtt9QbPfYDTGZ-CDNf0DXJA/edit?gid=0#gid=0), but especially SammyGoodTunes, for updating the dev spreadsheets memory addresses live while I was working on this. I wouldn't have been able to do anything without the documentation in the spreadsheet.
 * The [Phantom Hourglass Randomizer](https://github.com/phst-randomizer/ph-randomizer)
 * Dinopony, whose [Archipelago implementation for Zelda: Oracle of Seasons](https://github.com/Dinopony/ArchipelagoOoS/releases) I used as a starting point and a reference for how to make an Archipelago client using the bizhawk tools. And for making their code easy to understand!
 * The Manual for Archipelago discord, for lowering the entry threshold to Archipelago development.
 * Everyone who worked on Archipelago as a whole, for upholding high standards in code readability, and for creating such an amazing system.
 * Everyone who playtested the early versions of this, for giving enthusiasm and bug reports!

## FAQ

### What is currently implemented?

The whole game!
Things not implemented:
- Entrance Rando
- Postman locations
- That one treasure map from the girl on Molida Island

It's still early alpha, and there are lots of issues around! Report issues to the [phantom hourglass thread](https://discord.com/channels/731205301247803413/1256012365049233438) in the [Archipelago Discord](https://discord.gg/8Z65BR2)

### Is there a tracker?

[Universal Tracker](https://github.com/FarisTheAncient/Archipelago/releases) is supported.  
There's an [item tracker](https://github.com/ZobeePlays/PH-AP-Item-Tracker/tree/main) for [poptracker](https://github.com/black-sliver/PopTracker) by ZobeePlays.
Kizugaya/Kirito who made the [twilight princess poptracker](https://github.com/Kizugaya/TPRAP_poptracker) has started
working on a map tracker for [poptracker](https://github.com/black-sliver/PopTracker). More info coming soon!

### How do I warp to start?

Open the collection screen with select or from the menu tab, and press the button to switch the screens. Then enter any 
scene transition. There will be messages in the archipelago client to let you know it's working.

### Where do I find more ammo?

The Milk Bar on Mercay Island will give free refills. How nice

### My ship is slow. How do i go faster?
There are multiple ways of doing this, but my favorite is to create a cheat in bizhawk for address `021FA0A4` in 
`ARM7 system bus`, and set to any speed value. Default max speed is ``0x0080``.  My favorite is `0x0200`, or 4x speed.
Note that this forces a max speed, and makes turning weird- you'll need to toggle it on and off to do things precisely.


### My game crashed/I quit without saving

The client should give you back your missing items when you reenter the game. It can take a while if you're missing a 
lot of items, and there's not really any indicator for it.

### I collected some locations while the client wasn't connected

There is a backup system that reads savedata for missing checks when you enter a room. To trigger this, save and 
reenter the room with the locations in question. So far this is only implemented for save slot 1 and the overworld 
checks on Mercay Island, and some problematic checks like big rupees that can despawn or fall in the sea. I'm planning 
to add all locations in bulk soon.

This is also implemented for some problematic locations that are close together. Most of which have been fixed.

### How do small keys work in Temple of the Ocean King?

Since most locked doors in TotOK re-lock themselves each time you enter, TotOK has some special key rules:
* When you enter the dungeon, you start with as many TotOK small keys as you've found so far
* If you've opened the locked door on 1F that stays *permanently* unlocked, you don't get that key back. Logic assumes you can permanently lose that key, so you can safely open the 1F door unless you wanna go out of logic.
* When you reach the midway room with the yellow warp, it saves the number of keys you still have. When you take the yellow warp you should start with however many keys you saved.
* Logic can expect you to restart from the beginning to use your keys differently.
* The grappling hook can be used to skip a key on B3. This is in logic.

### My sword disappeared
This is an annoyng bug that i can't seem to track down, I'm adding a symptomatic fix in the next update until i figure out what causes it. if you want a bad backup to get your sword back, open the memory editor in bizhawk, find address `0x1BA644` in `Main RAM` and use the poke tool to add `1` to it, then save and quit.
