# Super Mario 64 EX Advanced Setup Guide

## Required Software

- Super Mario 64 US Rom (Japanese may work also. Europe and Shindou not supported)
- Either of [sm64pclauncher](https://github.com/N00byKing/sm64pclauncher/releases) or
- Cloning and building [sm64ex](https://github.com/N00byKing/sm64ex) manually.

NOTE: The above linked sm64pclauncher is a special version designed to work with the Archipelago build of sm64ex.
You can use other sm64-port based builds with it, but you can't use a different launcher with the Archipelago build of sm64ex.

## Building with Textures, Models and Patch Files

# Installation via sm64pclauncher (For Windows/Linux)
First, install [MSYS](https://www.msys2.org/) as described on the page. DO NOT INSTALL INTO A FOLDER PATH WITH SPACES.
Do all steps up to including step 6.
Best use default install directory.
Then follow the steps below

1. Go to the page linked for sm64pclauncher, and press on the topmost entry
3. Scroll down, and download the zip file
4. Unpack the zip file in an empty folder
5. Run the Launcher and press build.
6. Set the location where you installed MSYS when prompted. Check the "Install Dependencies" Checkbox
7. Set the Repo link to `https://github.com/N00byKing/sm64ex` and the Branch to `archipelago` (Top two boxes). You can choose the folder (Secound Box) at will, as long as it does not exist yet
8. Set the location for the Models Pack
9. Set the location for the Texture Pack
10. Point the Launcher to your Super Mario 64 US/JP Rom, and set the Region correspondingly
11. Copy the .patch file/s to the enachancements folder which is located in e.g. C:/sm64pclauncher/apmario/enhancements
12. click on refresh patchlist click on the patchs you want
13. Set Build Options. Recommended: `-jn` where `n` is the Number of CPU Cores, to build faster and add EXTERNAL_DATA=1 to the build options
SM64EX will now be compiled. The Launcher will appear to have crashed, but this is not likely the case. Best wait a bit, but there may be a problem if it takes longer than 10 Minutes

After it's done, the Build list should have another entry titled with what you named the folder in step 7.

NOTE: For some reason first start of the game always crashes the launcher. Just restart it.
If it still crashes, recheck if you typed the launch options correctly (Described in "Joining a MultiWorld Game")

# Manual Compilation (Linux/Windows)

Dependencies for Linux: `sdl2 glew cmake python make`.
Dependencies for Windows: `mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-glew mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2 git make python3 mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake`
SM64EX will link `jsoncpp` dynamic if installed. If not, it will compile and link statically.

1. Clone `https://github.com/N00byKing/sm64ex` recursively
2. Enter `sm64ex` and copy your Rom to `baserom.REGION.z64` where `REGION` is either `us` or `jp` respectively.
3. Compile with `make`. For faster compilation set the parameter `-jn` where `n` is the Number of CPU Cores. plus EXTERNAL_DATA=1

The Compiled binary will be in `build/REGION_pc/`.

# Other Build Options
There are more build options it's recommended to use only what is required but if you want to use these options USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
They are listed as Build Option, Default, Possible Values and Discription sourced from here https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64ex/wiki/Build-options
1. VERSION us (us,eu,jp,sh) Which ROM to use. The selected ROM has to be in the repo folder with the name baserom.$VERSION.z64. sh is currently broken
2. TARGET_BITS (32, 64) TARGET_BITS=n appends some compiler flags for an n-bit build. If the value is empty, the option does nothing, assuming your native toolchain will set everything up by itself. Use this only if you're having trouble otherwise.
3. TARGET_RPI 0, (0,1) If 1, select optimal settings for Raspberry PI see link here https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64ex/wiki/Helper-compiling-script-for-Raspberry-Pi
4. TARGET_WEB 0, (0,1) If 1, build Emscripten version. see link here https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64pc/wiki/Compiling-for-the-web
5. WINDOWS_BUILD (0,1) If 1, build for Windows. Usually set automatically if building on Windows.
6. OSX_BUILD 0, (0,1) If 1, build for OSX
7. WINDOWS_CONSOLE 0, (0,1) If 1, append -mconsole to Windows CFLAGS, making a console window appear while the game is running. Can be useful for debugging purposes.
8. DEBUG 0, (0,1) If 1, build with debug symbols and default optimization level. Otherwise build with -O2.
9. RENDER_API GL (GL,GL_LEGACY,D3d11,D3D12)Select rendering backend to use. GL corresponds to OpenGL 2.1, (gfx_opengl.c), GL_LEGACY corresponds to OpenGL 1.3, (gfx_opengl_legacy.c). Direct3D backends will also force WINDOW_API to DXGI.
10. WINDOWS_API SDL2 (SDL1.SDL2,DXGI) Select windowing backend. GL renderers force SDL1 or SDL2 and D3D renderers force DXGI for now, so you don't need to specify this.
11. AUDIO_API SDL2 (SDL1,SDL2) Specify list of controller backends to use. There's only one right now. Keep in mind that you CANNOT mix SDL1 and SDL2.
12. BETTERCAMERA 0, (0,1) If 1, build with analog camera support (uses Puppycam).
13. NODRAWINGDISTANCE 0, (0,1) If 1, build with disabled draw distance (every object is active at all times). May affect gameplay.
14. TEXTURE_FIX	0, (0,1) If 1, enable various texture-related bugfixes (e.g. fixes the smoke texture).
15. EXT_OPTIONS_MENU 1,	(0,1) If 1, enable Options menu. Accessed from the Pause menu by pressing R.
16. EXTERNAL_DATA 0, (0,1) If 1, load textures and soundbanks from external files. Allows you to use texture packs. The default data is copied to a res folder next to the produced executable.
17. DISCORDRPC 0, (0,1) If 1, enable Discord Rich Presence support. Only works on x86_64.
18. TEXTSAVES 0, (0,1) If 1, use INI-based save format instead of binary EEPROM dumps. Experimental.
