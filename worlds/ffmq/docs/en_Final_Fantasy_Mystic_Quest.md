# Final Fantasy Mystic Quest

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Besides items being shuffled, you have multiple options for shuffling maps, crest warps, and battlefield locations.
There are a number of other options for tweaking the difficulty of the game.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

Items received normally through chests, from NPCs, or battlefields are shuffled. Optionally, you may also include
the items from brown boxes.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any of the items which can be shuffled may also be placed into another player's world.

## What does another world's item look like in Final Fantasy Mystic Quest?

For locations that are originally boxes or chests, they will appear as a box if the item in it is categorized as a
filler item, and a chest if it contains a useful or advancement item. Trap items may randomly appear as a box or chest.
When opening a chest with an item for another player, you will see the Archipelago icon and it will tell you you've
found an "Archipelago Item"

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

A dialogue box will open to show you the item you've received. You will not receive items while you are in battle,
menus, or the overworld (except sometimes when closing the menu).
