# Hollow Knight for Archipelago Setup Guide

## Required Software
* Download and unzip the Lumafly Mod Manager from the [Lumafly website](https://themulhima.github.io/Lumafly/).
* A legal copy of Hollow Knight.

## Installing the Archipelago Mod using Lumafly
1. Launch Lumafly and ensure it locates your Hollow Knight installation directory.
2. Click the "Install" button near the "Archipelago" mod entry.
   * If desired, also install "Archipelago Map Mod" to use as an in-game tracker.
3. Launch the game, you're all set!

### What to do if Lumafly fails to find your XBox Game Pass installation directory
1. Enter the XBox app and move your mouse over "Hollow Knight" on the left sidebar. 
2. Click the three points then click "Manage".
3. Go to the "Files" tab and select "Browse...". 
4. Click "Hollow Knight", then "Content", then click the path bar and copy it.
5. Run Lumafly as an administrator and, when it asks you for the path, paste what you copied in step 4.

#### Alternative Method:
1. Click on your profile then "Settings". 
2. Go to the "General" tab and select "CHANGE FOLDER".
3. Look for a folder where you want to install the game (preferably inside a folder on your desktop) and copy the path.
4. Run Lumafly as an administrator and, when it asks you for the path, paste what you copied in step 3.

Note: The path folder needs to have the "Hollow Knight_Data" folder inside. 

## Configuring your YAML File
### What is a YAML and why do I need one?
You can see the [basic multiworld setup guide](/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en) here on the Archipelago website to learn 
about why Archipelago uses YAML files and what they're for.

### Where do I get a YAML?
You can use the [game settings page for Hollow Knight](/games/Hollow%20Knight/player-settings) here on the Archipelago 
website to generate a YAML using a graphical interface.

### Joining an Archipelago Game in Hollow Knight
1. Start the game after installing all necessary mods.
2. Create a **new save game.**
3. Select the **Archipelago** game mode from the mode selection screen.
4. Enter the correct settings for your Archipelago server.
5. Hit **Start** to begin the game. The game will stall for a few seconds while it does all item placements.
6. The game will immediately drop you into the randomized game. 
   * If you are waiting for a countdown then wait for it to lapse before hitting Start.
   * Or hit Start then pause the game once you're in it.
   
## Commands
While playing the multiworld you can interact with the server using various commands listed in the 
[commands guide](/tutorial/Archipelago/commands/en). As this game does not have an in-game text client at the moment,
You can optionally connect to the multiworld using the text client, which can be found in the 
[main Archipelago installation](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases) as Archipelago Text Client to
enter these commands.
