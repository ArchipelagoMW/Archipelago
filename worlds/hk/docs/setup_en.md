# Hollow Knight for Archipelago Setup Guide

## Required Software
* Download and unzip the Scarab Mod Manager from the [Scarab GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/fifty-six/Scarab/releases).
* A legal copy of Hollow Knight, not purchased or played through XBox Game Pass.
    * Unfortunately, the Game Pass version is not currently compatible with mods.

## Installing the Archipelago Mod using Scarab
1. Launch Scarab and ensure it locates your Hollow Knight installation directory.
2. Click the "Install" checkbox near the "Archipelago" mod entry.
3. Launch the game, you're all set!

## Configuring your YAML File
### What is a YAML and why do I need one?
You can see the [basic multiworld setup guide](/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en) here on the Archipelago website to learn 
about why Archipelago uses YAML files and what they're for.

### Where do I get a YAML?
You can use the [game settings page for Hollow Knight](/games/Hollow%20Knight/player-settings) here on the Archipelago 
website to generate a YAML using a graphical interface.

### Joining an Archipelago Game in Hollow Knight
1. Start the game after installing all necessary mods.
2. Create a **new save game.**
3. Select the **Archipelago** game mode from the mode selection screen.
4. Enter the correct settings for your Archipelago server.
5. Hit **Start** to begin the game. The game will stall for a few seconds while it does all item placements.
6. The game will immediately drop you into the randomized game. 
   * If you are waiting for a countdown then wait for it to lapse before hitting Start.
   * Or hit Start then pause the game once you're in it.
   
## Commands
While playing the multiworld you can interact with the server using various commands listed in the 
[commands guide](/tutorial/Archipelago/commands/en). As this game does not have an in-game text client at the moment,
You can optionally connect to the multiworld using the text client, which can be found in the 
[main Archipelago installation](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases) as Archipelago Text Client to
enter these commands.
