# Subnautica

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

The most noticeable change is the complete removal of freestanding technologies. The technology blueprints normally
awarded from scanning those items have been shuffled into location checks throughout the AP item pool.

## What is the goal of Subnautica when randomized?

There are four goals currently available. The Launch goal has you leave the planet. The Free goal has you cure the plague. Infected is achieved at maximum infection level. Drive asks you to repair the Aurora Drive Core.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

Most of the technologies the player will need throughout the game will be shuffled. 
Location checks in Subnautica are data pads and technology lockers. 

Optionally up to 50 Creatures to scan can be included as well, for each one added a random duplicate item is created.

## What does another world's item look like in Subnautica?

player's world.
