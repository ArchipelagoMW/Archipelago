# Kingdom Hearts RE Chain of Memories (PC)

## Where is the options page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-options) contains most of the options you need to 
configure and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

The Kingdom Hearts RE Chain of Memories Randomizer will remove cards you pick up in the overworld, 
moogle shops, and as rewards from boss battles from your inventory.

You can receive battle cards, map cards, world cards, and sleights as multiworld items.

The entire castle is open from the start after completing Traverse Town.  
Floors you haven't unlocked are assigned Traverse Town, otherwise they will be assigned normally.

Your goal is find all 8 friend cards (Aladdin, Ariel, Beast, Donald, Goofy, Jack, Peter Pan, Pluto).  
These are tracked in Deck 3.

When you find 8 friend cards and have defeated all Exit Hall bosses, Castle Oblivion is assigned to Floor 13, 
allowing you to challenge Marluxia.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

### Items

World Unlocks, Key to Rewards for each floor, Enemy Cards, Sleights, and Card Sets are shuffled into the item pool.

Card Sets are comprised of a card type and a value range which is defined in your settings.

### Locations

Acquiring certain cards and sleights for the first time are locations which yield a randomized multiworld item.

Opening each floor's Room of Beginnings, Room of Guidance, and Room of Truth for the first time are also locations.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any of the items which can be shuffled may also be placed into another player's world. It is possible to choose to limit

certain items to your own world.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

When the player receives an item, your client will display a message displaying the item you have obtained.
