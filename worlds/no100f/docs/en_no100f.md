# Scooby-Doo! Night of 100 Frights

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Items which the player would normally acquire throughout the game have been moved around. Logic remains, so the game is
always able to be completed, but because of the item shuffle the player may need to access certain areas before they
would in the vanilla game.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

-Upgrades like the Springs/Umbrella as well as Gum and Soap Ammo upgrades will always be shuffled. 

-Optionally you can also shuffle Monster Tokens, Keys, Warp Gates and Scooby Snack Pickups.

## Current QOL Fixes (enabled by default)
- Prevent player from going through the a loading zone in Aghast that would get them stuck if they don't have the helmet
- Prevent player from going from Cellar 4 to Clamor 4 if they don't have the helmet (Requires glitches to escape)
- Allow player to warp with pause menu at any time

## What is the goal of Scooby Doo: Night of 100 Frights?

Same as vanilla, beat Tim Curry in a brawl to the death.

Optionally you can also require all Monster Tokens to be found, or all bosses to be defeated, or even whatever amounts of scooby snacks you want.
