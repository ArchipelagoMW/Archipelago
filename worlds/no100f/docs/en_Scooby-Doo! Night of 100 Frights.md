# Scooby-Doo! Night of 100 Frights

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## Where is the setup guide?

The [setup guide](/tutorial/Scooby-Doo!%20Night%20of%20100%20Frights/setup/en) is located here.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Items which the player would normally acquire throughout the game have been moved around. Logic remains, so the game is
always able to be completed, but because of the item shuffle the player may need to access certain areas before they
would in the vanilla game.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

-Upgrades like the Springs/Umbrella as well as Gum and Soap Ammo upgrades will always be shuffled. 

-Optionally you can also shuffle Monster Tokens, Keys, Warp Gates and Scooby Snack Pickups.

## Current QOL Fixes (enabled by default)
- Allow player to warp with pause menu at any time
- Allow player to forcibly reset the current room to escape from any base game softlocks by using '/resetscooby' as a command

## What is the goal of Scooby Doo: Night of 100 Frights?

Same as vanilla, beat Tim Curry in a brawl to the death. (Beating the Mastermind in the Super Secret Lab)

Optionally you can also require all Monster Tokens to be found, or all bosses to be defeated, or even whatever amounts of scooby snacks you want.

## Known issues
- Dying in Creepy 2 can sometimes cause items to be unreachable, specifically the keys in the room.  If you happen to die before grabbing them
then you can just start a new game and quickly navigate back to that point to send them.  Virtually all progress in the game including all items received will carry over to any new game made.
