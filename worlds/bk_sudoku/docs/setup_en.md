# BK Sudoku Setup Guide

## Required Software
- [Bk Sudoku](https://github.com/Jarno458/sudoku)
- Windows 8 or higher

## General Concept

This is a client that can connect to any multiworld slot, and lets you play Sudoku to unlock random hints for that slot's locations.

Due to the fact that the Sudoku client may connect to any slot, it is not necessary to generate a YAML for this game as it does not generate any new slots in the multiworld session.

## Installation Procedures

Go to the latest release on [BK Sudoku Releases](https://github.com/Jarno458/sudoku/releases). Download and extract the `Bk_Sudoku.zip` file.

## Joining a MultiWorld Game

1. Run Bk_Sudoku.exe
2. Enter the name of the slot you wish to connect to
3. Enter the server url & port number
4. Press connect
5. Choose difficulty
6. Try to solve the Sudoku
