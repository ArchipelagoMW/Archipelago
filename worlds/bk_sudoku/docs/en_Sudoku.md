# Bk Sudoku

## What is this game?

Bk Sudoku is not like your average Archipelago game, it is instead a generic Sudoku client that can connect to an existing multiworld. When connected to an multiworld you can play the game to unlock random hints for your game. While slow and not very effective it will give you something to do when you have no checks left in your game.

## What hints are unlocked?

After completing a Sudoku puzzle the game will unlock 1 random hint of a location in the current slot you are connected to that has not yet been found/checked. It is possible that the same location is hinted for multiple times as long as it remains unchecked.

## Where is the settings page?

There is no settings page, this game cannot be used in your yamls, however the client can connect to any other generated slot.
