# Bk Sudoku

## What is this game?

Bk Sudoku is not like your average Archipelago game, it is instead a generic Sudoku client that can connect to an existing multiworld. When connected to an multiworld you can play the game to unlock random hints for your game. While slow and not very effective it will give you something to do when you have no checks left in your game.

## Where is the settings page?

There is no settings page, this game cannot be used in your yamls, however the client can connect to any other generated slot
