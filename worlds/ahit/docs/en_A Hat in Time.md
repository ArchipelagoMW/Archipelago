# A Hat in Time

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Items which the player would normally acquire throughout the game have been moved around. 
Chapter costs are randomized in a progressive order based on your options, 
so for example you could go to Subcon Forest -> Battle of the Birds -> Alpine Skyline, etc. in that order. 
If act shuffle is turned on, the levels and Time Rifts in these chapters will be randomized as well.
 
To unlock and access a chapter's Time Rift in act shuffle, 
the levels in place of the original acts required to unlock the Time Rift in the vanilla game must be completed, 
and then you must enter a level that allows you to access that Time Rift. 
For example, Time Rift: Bazaar requires Heating Up Mafia Town to be completed in the vanilla game. 
To unlock this Time Rift in act shuffle (and therefore the level it contains) 
you must complete the level that was shuffled in place of Heating Up Mafia Town 
and then enter the Time Rift through a Mafia Town level.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

Time Pieces, Relics, Yarn, Badges, and most other items are shuffled. 
Unlike in the vanilla game, yarn is typeless, and hats will be automatically stitched 
in a set order once you gather enough yarn for each hat. 
Hats can also optionally be shuffled as individual items instead. 
Any items in the world, shops, act completions, 
and optionally storybook pages or Death Wish contracts are locations.

Any freestanding items that are considered to be progression or useful 
will have a rainbow streak particle attached to them. 
Filler items will have a white glow attached to them instead.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any of the items which can be shuffled may also be placed into another player's world. It is possible to choose to limit
certain items to your own world.

## What does another world's item look like in A Hat in Time?

Items belonging to other worlds are represented by a badge with the Archipelago logo on it.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

When the player receives an item, it will play the item collect effect and information about the item 
will be printed on the screen and in the in-game developer console.

## Is the DLC required to play A Hat in Time in Archipelago?

No, the DLC expansions are not required to play. Their content can be enabled through certain options 
that are disabled by default, but please don't turn them on if you don't own the respective DLC.
