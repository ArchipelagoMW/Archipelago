# Setup Guide for A Hat in Time in Archipelago

## Required Software
- [Steam release of A Hat in Time](https://store.steampowered.com/app/253230/A_Hat_in_Time/)

- [Archipelago Workshop Mod for A Hat in Time](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3026842601)


## Instructions

1. Have Steam running. Open the Steam console with [this link.](steam://open/console)

2. In the Steam console, enter the following command: 
`download_depot 253230 253232 7770543545116491859`. ***Wait for the console to say the download is finished!***

3. Once the download finishes, go to `steamapps/content/app_253230` in Steam's program folder.

4. There should be a folder named `depot_253232`. Rename it to HatinTime_AP and move it to your `steamapps/common` folder.

5. In the HatinTime_AP folder, navigate to `Binaries/Win64` and create a new file: `steam_appid.txt`. In this new text file, input the number **253230** on the first line.

6. Create a shortcut of `HatinTimeGame.exe` from that folder and move it to wherever you'd like. You will use this shortcut to open the Archipelago-compatible version of A Hat in Time.

7. Start up the game using your new shortcut. To confirm if you are on the correct version, go to Settings -> Game Settings. If you don't see an option labelled ***Live Game Events*** you should be running the correct version of the game. In Game Settings, make sure ***Enable Developer Console*** is checked.


## Connecting to the Archipelago server

To connect to the multiworld server, simply run the **ArchipelagoAHITClient** and connect it to the Archipelago server. The game will connect to the client automatically when you create a new save file.


## Console Commands

Commands will not work on the title screen, you must be in-game to use them. To use console commands, make sure ***Enable Developer Console*** is checked in Game Settings and press the tilde key or TAB while in-game.

`ap_say <message>` - Send a chat message to the server. Supports commands, such as `!hint` or `!release`.

`ap_deathlink` - Toggle Death Link.

`ap_set_connection_info <ip> <port>` - Usually not necessary. Set the connection info for the save file. **The IP address MUST be in double quotes!**
