# Super Mario World - APWorld plugin for Archipelago

Mario woke up to discover the Princess and Yoshi are missing! Surely Bowser is behind it again, but something feels a little...different this time.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Mario's basic abilities are removed, and placed into the item pool as items that any player can find. This includes:
- Carry
- Climb
- Run
- P-Switch
- Swim
- Spin Jump
- Yoshi

Additionally, the ability to use powerups (Mushrooms, Fire Flowers, Capes, Stars, and P-Balloons) are shuffled into the item pool, as are the Four Switch Palaces.

## What is the goal of Super Mario World when randomized?

There are two goals which can be chosen:
- `Bowser`: Reach Bowser's Castle and defeat Bowser, after defeating a certain number of bosses.
- `Yoshi Egg Hunt`: Collect a certain number of Yoshi Eggs, then return to Yoshi's House

## What items and locations get shuffled?

Each unique level exit awards a location check. Additionally, the following in-level actions can be set to award a location check:
- Collecting Five Dragon Coins
- Collecting 3-Up Moons
- Activating Bonus Blocks
- Receiving Hidden 1-Ups
- Hitting Blocks containing coins or items

Mario's various abilities and powerups as described above are placed into the item pool.
If the player is playing Yoshi Egg Hunt, a certain number of Yoshi Eggs will be placed into the item pool.
Any additional items that are needed to fill out the item pool will be 1-Up Mushrooms, bundles of coins, or, if enabled, various trap items.
