# Peaks of Yore

## Where is the options page?
The player options page for this game is located [here](../player-options). It contains all the options
you need to configure and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?
Books (fundamentals, intermediate etc), in-cabin artefacts, tools as well as extra filler (extra ropes, chalk and bird seeds)
have been turned into items. 

Peaks and on-peak artefacts (ropes, trash, bird seeds etc.) have all been turned into checks.

## What is the goal of Peaks of Yore when randomized?
There are multiple options to select from:
- All Peaks: You must summit (& stamp) every peak from the selected books to win.
- All Artefacts: You must collect all artefacts on peaks in the selected books (does not include ropes or bird seeds,
  only items you should normally clean).
- All Peaks All Artefacts: Both of the above.
- All: Every check, peaks, ropes, bird seeds, artefacts.

## Which items can be in another player's world?
As described above, books (except the starting one), ropes, tools, in-cabin artefacts. If there are more checks
than items, filler items are added: extra ropes, chalk uses, coffee uses & bird seed uses.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?
When an item is received, the next time the player enters the cabin, a package is received containing
all the received items.

## Are there any limitations compared to vanilla Peaks of Yore?
- Peaks may get very hard as tools (including) crampons are also items to be received, leaving the possibility that 
harder peaks may have to be summited without early-game unlocks.

## Notes
- The Alps DLC currently has no implementation, it is not recommended to go to the alps during an Archipelago session,
as that may lead to unforeseen consequences.
