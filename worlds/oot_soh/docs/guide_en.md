# Ship of Harkinian Setup Guide

## Required Software

- [Ship of Harkinian](https://www.shipofharkinian.com/) for PC (Steam Deck also supported)
- An Ocarina of Time ROM. Every version of OoT is supported!


## Installation

### Installing Ship of Harkinian

Please follow the instructions that come with your Ship of Harkinian download. The SoH discord also has a guide to help you extracting your ROM
from whichever physical copy you own.


### How to play Archipelago on Ship of Harkinian

In Ship or Harkinian's quest select menu, select Archipelago. Follow the on-screen 
instructions. After creating the save file, this file will be linked to your Archipelago slot and will automatically try to connect when loaded.

In the ESC menu you can find the built in Archipelago console, go to the "Network" tab, then "Archipelago" in the sidebar.

Coop play on the same slot is available! Just make a save file with the same slot details, and locations will automatically get synched between players.

Please take a look at the other options inside the ESC menu to tweak your experience. Pretty much every regular SoH enhancement will work perfectly fine within
Archipelago saves, including all the trackers, installed graphical mods and QoL enhancements!
