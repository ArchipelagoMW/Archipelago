# Ship of Harkinian

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a config file.


## What is Ship of Harkinian (SoH)?

Ship of Harkinian is a fanmade PC port of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. Due to it being a port, it has access to a ton
of enhancements like native widescreen support, too many optional Quality of Life options to name them all here, built-in
trackers, built-in randomizer, and much more. If you're curious about the specifics, please download SoH and take a look
through the ESC menu!


## I haven't played Ocarina of Time before.

Please play Ocarina of Time in vanilla first! Preferably go for 100% completion. Ship of Harkinian has presets for its
enhancements, including one for new players. You'll have a much better time in the randomizer when you've played
through the game first. 


## What does randomization do to this game?

Pretty much every item can be randomized, like every chest, every freestanding item, shop items, every major item,
dungeon rewards, etc. There's additional options too like setting the requirement to open the Rainbow Bridge to
Ganon's Castle or the requirement to receive Ganon's Castle Boss Key and shuffle things like Boss Souls, requiring 
to be found before the respective boss can be fought. Many of these are optional and can be viewed within the player options page.


## What is the goal of Ship of Harkinian when randomized?

The standard goal is the same as the vanilla game. Find whatever requirements are needed to reach and beat Ganondorf and Ganon.
These will depend on chosen settings.

There's an alternative goal in Triforce Hunt, where the player has to find the required amount of pieces and will be automatically
warped to the end credits once finding the proper amount of pieces. If this is turned on, Ganon's Castle Boss Key will be granted
after loading back into the savefile if players would like to fight that afterwards.


## What items from Ship of Harkinian can appear in another player's world?

Every item has a chance to appear in another player's world.


## How many checks are in Ship of Harkinian?

This depends heavily on the player's chosen settings. By default it's around 370 checks and it goes up to around 1600 checks
when shuffling everything.


## What do items from other worlds look like in Ship of Harkinian?

Ship of Harkinian uses custom models for Archipelago items. Progressive items will show up as coloured orbs with an arrow besides
them. Useful items are the same but without the arrow. Junk items will appear as a black & white version of this. Items for
yourself will show up just like a regular randomizer, showing the model of whatever item it is.


## Is there a tracker pack?

They aren't needed! Ship of Harkinian comes with a built-in item tracker, entrance tracker and check tracker. They're found 
within the Randomizer section of the ESC menu.
