# Yu-Gi-Oh! Dungeon Dice Monsters

## What does randomization do to this game?

You will play the game entirely in Free Duel mode. You will start with the defined number of duelists unlocked (set in your YAML),
defeating each duelist for the first time will unlock a check. Over time you will unlock more duelists as those checks are found
by players in the multiworld. Once all duelists other than Yami Yugi are beaten once, he will be unlocked.

## What is the goal of Yu-Gi-Oh! Dungeon Dice Monsters when randomized?

Beat Yami Yugi.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

Your access to more duelists is shuffled. Dice are planned to be added in the future.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Your Duelist Unlock items (allowing you to play against them in Free Duel).

## What does another world's item look like in Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories

Your item acquisitions take the form of having defeated duelists. As such,
you'll have to check the BizHawk Client to know the actual items that were unlocked from those locations.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

Currently, the items are silently added to the player's inventory, which can be seen in the dice pool or Free Duel screen.
