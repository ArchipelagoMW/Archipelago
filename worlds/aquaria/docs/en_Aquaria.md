## What does randomization do to this game?
The locations in the randomizer are:

- All sing bulbs
- All Mithalas Urns
- All Sunken City crates
- Collectible treasure locations (including pet eggs and costumes)
- Beating Simon Says
- Li cave
- Every Transportation Turtle (also called transturtle)
- Locations where you get songs:
    * Erulian spirit crystal
    * Energy status mini-boss
    * Beating Mithalan God boss
    * Fish Cave puzzle
    * Beating Drunian God boss
    * Beating Lumerean God boss
    * Breaking Li cage in the body

Note that, unlike the vanilla game, when opening sing bulbs, Mithalas urns and Sunken City crates,
nothing will come out of them. The moment those bulbs, urns and crates are opened, the location is considered checked.

The items in the randomizer are:
- Dishes (used to learn recipes)<sup>*</sup>
- Some ingredients
- The Wok (third plate used to cook 3-ingredient recipes everywhere)
- All collectible treasure (including pet eggs and costumes)
- Li and Li's song
- All songs (other than Li's song since it is learned when Li is obtained)
- Transportation to transturtles

Also, there is the option to randomize every ingredient drops (from fishes, monsters
or plants).

<sup>*</sup> Note that, unlike in the vanilla game, the recipes for dishes (other than the Sea Loaf)
cannot be cooked (or learned) before being obtained as randomized items. Also, enemies and plants
that drop dishes that have not been learned before will drop ingredients of this dish instead.

## What is the goal of the game?
The goal of the Aquaria game is to beat the creator. You can also add other goals like getting
secret memories, beating a number of mini-bosses and beating a number of bosses.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

## What does another world's item look like in Aquaria?

what has been collected and who will receive it.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

the item from and which one it was.
