# Aquaria Randomizer Setup Guide

## Required Software

- The original Aquaria Game (purchasable from most online game stores)
- The [Aquaria randomizer](https://github.com/tioui/Aquaria_Randomizer/releases)

## Optional Software
 
- For sending [commands](/tutorial/Archipelago/commands/en) like `!hint`: the TextClient from [the most recent Archipelago release](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases)

## Installation and execution Procedures

### Windows

First, you should copy the original Aquaria folder game. The randomizer will possibly modify the game so that
the original game will stop working. Copying the folder will guarantee that the original game keeps on working.
Also, in Windows, the save files are stored in the Aquaria folder. So copying the Aquaria folder for every Multiworld
game you play will make sure that every game has its own save game.

Unzip the Aquaria randomizer release and copy all unzipped files in the Aquaria game folder. The unzipped files are:
- aquaria_randomizer.exe
- OpenAL32.dll
- override (directory)
- SDL2.dll
- usersettings.xml
- wrap_oal.dll
- cacert.pem

If there is a conflict between files in the original game folder and the unzipped files, you should overwrite
the original files with the ones from the unzipped randomizer.

Finally, to launch the randomizer, you must use the command line interface (you can open the command line interface
by typing `cmd` in the address bar of the Windows File Explorer). Here is the command line used to start the
randomizer:

```bash
aquaria_randomizer.exe --name YourName --server theServer:thePort
```

or, if the room has a password:

```bash
aquaria_randomizer.exe  --name YourName --server theServer:thePort --password thePassword
```

### Linux when using the AppImage

If you use the AppImage, just copy it into the Aquaria game folder. You then have to make it executable. You
can do that from command line by using:

```bash
chmod +x Aquaria_Randomizer-*.AppImage
```

or by using the Graphical Explorer of your system.

To launch the randomizer, just launch in command line:

```bash
./Aquaria_Randomizer-*.AppImage --name YourName --server theServer:thePort
```

or, if the room has a password:

```bash
./Aquaria_Randomizer-*.AppImage --name YourName --server theServer:thePort --password thePassword
```

Note that you should not have multiple Aquaria_Randomizer AppImage file in the same folder. If this situation occurs,
the preceding commands will launch the game multiple times.

### Linux when using the tar file

First, you should copy the original Aquaria folder game. The randomizer will possibly modify the game so that
the original game will stop working. Copying the folder will guarantee that the original game keeps on working.

Untar the Aquaria randomizer release and copy all extracted files in the Aquaria game folder. The extracted files are:
- aquaria_randomizer
- override (directory)
- usersettings.xml
- cacert.pem

If there is a conflict between files in the original game folder and the extracted files, you should overwrite
the original files with the ones from the extracted randomizer files.

Then, you should use your system package manager to install `liblua5`, `libogg`, `libvorbis`, `libopenal` and `libsdl2`.
On Debian base system (like Ubuntu), you can use the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install liblua5.1-0-dev libogg-dev libvorbis-dev libopenal-dev libsdl2-dev
```

Also, if there are certain `.so` files in the original Aquaria game folder (`libgcc_s.so.1`, `libopenal.so.1`,
`libSDL-1.2.so.0` and `libstdc++.so.6`), you should remove them from the Aquaria Randomizer game folder. Those are
old libraries that will not work on the recent build of the randomizer.

To launch the randomizer, just launch in command line:

```bash
./aquaria_randomizer --name YourName --server theServer:thePort
```

or, if the room has a password:

```bash
./aquaria_randomizer --name YourName --server theServer:thePort --password thePassword
```

Note: If you get a permission denied error when using the command line, you can use this command to be
sure that your executable has executable permission:

```bash
chmod +x aquaria_randomizer
```
