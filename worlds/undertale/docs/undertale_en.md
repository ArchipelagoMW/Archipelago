# Undertale Randomizer Setup Guide

### Required Software

- Undertale from the [Steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/391540)
- Archipelago from the [Archipelago Releases Page](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases)
    - (select `Undertale Client` during installation.)

### First time setup

Start the Undertale client, and in the bottom text box, input `/auto_patch (Input your Undertale install directory here)` (It is usually located at `C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\Undertale`, but it can be different, you can more easily find the directory
by opening the Undertale directory through Steam), it will then make an Undertale folder that will be created in the
Archipelago install location. That contains the version of Undertale you will use for Archipelago. (You will need to
redo this step when updating Archipelago.)

### Connect to the MultiServer

Make sure both Undertale and its client are running. (Undertale will ask for a saveslot, it can be 1 through 99, none 
of the slots will overwrite your vanilla save, although you may want to make a backup just in case.)

In the top text box of the client, type the 
`Ip Address` (or `Hostname`) and `Port` separated with a `:` symbol. (Ex. `archipelago.gg:38281`)

The client will then ask for the slot name, input that in the text box at the bottom of the client.

### Play the game

When the console tells you that you have joined the room, you're all set. Congratulations on successfully joining a
multiworld game!

### Where do I get a YAML file?

You can customize your settings by visiting the [Undertale Player Settings Page](/games/Undertale/player-settings)
