# Undertale

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What is considered a location check in Undertale?

Location checks in Undertale are all the spots in the game where you can get an item. Exceptions are Dog Residue, 
the Nicecream bought in Hotland, and anything you cannot get on your chosen route.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

When the player receives an item in Undertale, it will go into their inventory if they have space, otherwise it will 
wait until they do have space.

## What is the victory condition?

Victory is achieved when the player completes their chosen route. If they chose `all_routes` then they need to complete 
every major route in the game, those being `Pacifist`, `Neutral`, and `Genocide`.

## What is different from the vanilla game?

There are some major differences between vanilla and the randomizer. 

There are now doors to every major area in the underground located in the flower room (The first room of the game), those being Ruins, Snowdin, Waterfall, Hotland, and Core. 
Each door needs their respective key from the pool to enter. 
You start with one key for a random door. (Core will never be given to start with.) 
The rest of the keys will be in the item pool.

Genocide works a little differently in terms of the requirements. 
You now only need to get through Core and fight Mettaton NEO, and then beat Sans, to win. 
If you choose to fight other major bosses, you will still need to grind out the area before fighting them like normal.

Pacifist is mostly the same, except you are not required to go to the Ruins to spare Toriel, 
you only need to spare Papyrus, Undyne, and Mettaton EX. Although you still cannot kill anyone. 
You are also still required to do the date/hangout with Papyrus, the hangout with Undyne, and the date with Alphys, 
in that order, before entering the True Lab.

You now require custom items to Hangout with Papyrus, Undyne, to enter the True Lab, and to fight Mettaton EX/NEO. 
Those being `Complete Skeleton`, `Fish`, `DT Extractor`, and `Mettaton Plush`.

The Riverperson will only take you to locations you have actually seen the Riverperson at. 
Meaning they will only take you to, for example, Waterfall, if you have seen the Riverperson at Waterfall at least once.

If you press `W` while in the save menu, you will teleport back to the flower room, for quick access to the other areas.
