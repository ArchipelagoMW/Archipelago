# Undertale

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What is considered a location check in Undertale?

Location checks in Undertale are all the spots in the game where you can get an item. Exceptions are Dog Residue, 
the Nicecream bought in Hotland, and anything you cannot get in your chosen route.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

When the player receives an item in Undertale, it will go into their inventory if they have space, otherwise it will 
wait until they do have space. That includes items that don't appear in your inventory.

## What is the victory condition?

Victory is achieved when the player completes their chosen route. If they chose `all_routes` then they need to complete 
every major route in the game, those being `Pacifist`, `Neutral`, and `Genocide`.
