# Terraria for Archipelago Setup Guide

## Required Software

Download and install [Terraria](https://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/Terraria/)
and [TModLoader](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1281930/tModLoader/) on Steam

## Installing the Archipelago Mod

Subscribe to [the mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2922217554) on Steam.

This mod might not work with mods that significantly alter progression or vanilla features. It is
highly recommended to use utility mods and features to speed up gameplay, such as:

- Journey Mode
- Ore Excavator
- Magic Storage
- Alchemist NPC Lite
    - (May be used to break progression)
- Reduced Grinding
- Upgraded Research

## Configuring your YAML File

### What is a YAML and why do I need one?

You can see the [basic multiworld setup guide](/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en) here
on the Archipelago website to learn about why Archipelago uses YAML files and what they're for.

### Where do I get a YAML?

You can use the [game settings page for Terraria](/games/Terraria/player-settings) here
on the Archipelago website to generate a YAML using a graphical interface.

## Joining an Archipelago Game in Terraria

1. Launch TModLoader
2. In Workshop > Manage Mods, edit Archipelago Randomizer's settings
    - "Name" should be the player name you set when creating your YAML file
    - "Port" should be the port number associated with the Archipelago server. It will be a 4 or 5
    digit number.
    - If you're not hosting your game on the Archipelago website, change "Address" to the server's
    URL or IP address
3. Create a new character and world as normal (or use an existing one if you prefer). Terraria is
usually significantly more difficult with this mod, so it is recommended to choose a lower
difficulty than you normally would.
4. Open the world in single player or multiplayer
5. When you're ready, open chat, and enter `/apstart` to start the game.
   
## Commands

While playing Archipelago, you can interact with the server using the commands listed in the
[commands guide](/tutorial/Archipelago/commands/en). To send a command, open chat, and enter `/ap`,
followed by the command you want to send. For example, `/ap !help`.
