# Terraria

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Boss/event flags are randomized. So, defeating Empress of Light could give you Post-Skeletron, which allows you to enter
the Dungeon, for example. In your player options, you may also add item rewards and achievements to the pool.

## What Terraria items can appear in other players' worlds?

Boss/event flags, and item rewards if enabled.

## What does another world's item look like in Terraria?

You won't see the items in Terraria, but you will receive a chat message, telling you what item you sent to whom.
