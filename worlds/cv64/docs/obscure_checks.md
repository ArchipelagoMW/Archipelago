# Obscure locations in the AP Castlevania 64 randomizer



## Forest of Silence

#### Invisible bridge platform
A square platform floating off to the side of the broken bridge between the three-crypt and Werewolf areas. There's an
invisible bridge connecting it with the middle piece on the broken bridge that you can cross over to reach it. This is
where you normally get the Special1 in vanilla that unlocks Hard Mode.

### Invisible Items
#### Dirge maiden pedestal plaque
This plaque in question can be found on the statue pedestal with a torch on it in the area right after the first switch gate,
near the cliff where the breakable rock can be found. The plaque reads "A maiden sings a dirge" if you check it after you
pick up the item there, hence the name of all the locations in this area.

#### Werewolf statue plaque
The plaque on the statue pedestal in the area inhabited by the Werewolf. Reading this plaque after picking up the item
says it's "the lady who blesses and restores."

### 3-Hit Breakables
#### Dirge maiden pedestal rock
This rock can be found near the cliff behind the empty above-mentioned dirge maiden pedestal. Normally has a ton of money
in vanilla, contains 5 checks in rando.

#### Bat archway rock
After the broken bridge containing the invisible pathway to the Special1 in vanilla, this rock is off to the side in front
of the gate frame with a swarm of bats that come at you, before the Werewolf's territory. Contains 4 checks. If you are new
to speedrunning the vanilla game and haven't yet learned the RNG manip strats, this is a guaranteed spot to find a PowerUp at.



## Castle Wall
#### Above bottom right/left tower door
These checks are located on top of the bottom doorways inside the both the Left and Right Tower. You have to drop from above
to reach them. In the case of the left tower, it's probably easiest to wait on the green platform directly above it until it flips.

#### Left tower child ledge
When you reach the bridge of four rotating green platforms, look towards the pillar in the center of the room (hold C-up to
enter first person view), and you'll see this. There's an invisible bridge between the rotating platforms and the tiny ledge
that you can use to get to and from it. In Legacy of Darkness, it is on this ledge where one of Henry's children is found.

### Invisible Items
#### Sandbag shelf - Left
If you thought the PowerUp on this shelf in vanilla CV64 was the only thing here, then you'd be wrong! Hidden inside the
sandbags near the item is another item you can pick up before subsequent checks on this spot yield "only sand and gravel".
Legacy took this item out entirely, interestingly enough.

### 3-Hit Breakables
#### Upper rampart savepoint slab
After killing the two White Dragons and flipping their switch, drop down onto this platform from the top, and you'll find
it near the White Jewel. Contains 5 checks that are all normally Red Jewels in vanilla, making it an excellent place to
fuel up at if you're not doing Left Tower Skip. Just be careful of the infinitely spawning skeletons!

#### Dracula switch slab
Located behind the door that you come out of at the top of the left tower where you encounter Totally Real Dracula in a
cutscene. Contains 5 checks that are all normally money; take note of all these money spots if you're plaing vanilla and
plan on trying to trigger the Renon fight.



## Villa
#### Outer front gate platform
From the start of the level, turn right, and you'll see a platform with a torch above a torch on the ground. This upper torch
is reachable via an invisible platform that you can grab and pull yourself up onto. The PAL version and onwards removed
this secret entirely, interestingly enough.

#### Front yard cross grave near gates/porch
In the Villa's front yard area are two cross-shaped grave markers that are actually 1-hit breakables just like torches.
They contain a check each.

#### Midnight fountain
At exactly midnight (0:00 on the pause screen), a pillar in the fountain's base will rise to give you access to the six
checks on the upper parts of the fountain. If you're playing with Disable Time Requirements enabled, this pillar will be
raised regardless of the current time.

#### Vincent
Vincent has a check that he will give to you by speaking to him after triggering the Rosa cutscene at 3 AM in the rose
garden. With Disable Time Requirements enabled, the Rosa cutscene will trigger at any time.

#### Living room ceiling light
In the rectangular living room with ghosts and flying skulls that come at you, there are two yellow lights on the ceiling
and one red light between them. The red light can be broken for a check; just jump directly below it and use your c-left
attack to hit it.

#### Front maze garden - Frankie's right dead-end urn
When you first enter the maze, before going to trigger the Malus cutscene, go forward, right at the one-way door, then right
at the T-junction, and you'll reach a dead-end where the Gardner is just going about his business. The urn on the left
at this dead-end can be broken for a check; it's the ONLY urn in the entire maze that can be broken like this.

#### Crypt bridge upstream
After unlocking the Copper Door, follow the stream all the way past the bridge to end up at this torch.
I see many people miss this one.

### Invisible Items
#### Front yard visitor's tombstone
The tombstone closest to the Villa building itself, in the top-right corner if approaching from the gates. If you are
familiar with the puzzle here in Cornell's quest in Legacy, it's the tombstone prepared for "anybody else who drops by
to visit".

#### Foyer sofa
The first sofa in the foyer, on the upper floor to the right.

#### Mary's room table
The table closer to the mirror on the right in the small room adjacent to the bedroom, where Mary would normally be found
in Cornell's story in Legacy.

#### Dining room rose vase
The vase of roses in the dining room that a rose falls out of in the cutscene here to warn Reinhardt/Carrie of the vampire
villager.

#### Living room clawed painting
The painting with claw marks on it above the fireplace in the middle of the living room.

#### Living room lion head
The lion head on the left wall of the living room (if you entered from one of the doors to the main hallway).

#### Maze garden exit knight
The suit of armor in the stairs room before the Maze Garden, where Renon normally introduces himself.

#### Storeroom statue
The weird statue in the back of the Storeroom. If you check it again after taking its item, the game questions why would
someone make something like it.

#### Archives table
The table in the middle of the Archives. In Legacy, this is where Oldrey's diary normally sits if you are playing Cornell.

#### Malus's hiding bush
The bush that Reinhardt/Carrie find Malus hiding in at the start of the Maze Garden chase sequence.

### 3-Hit Breakables
#### Foyer chandelier
The big chandelier above the foyer can be broken for 5 assorted items, all of which become checks in rando with the multi
hits setting on. This is the only 3-hit breakable in the entire stage. <br>

Here's a fun fact about the chandelier: for some reason, KCEK made this thing a completely separate object from every other
3-hit breakable in the game, complete with its own distinct code that I had to modify entirely separately as I was making
this rando to make the 3-hit breakable setting feasible! What fun!



## Tunnel
#### Stepping stone alcove
After the first save following the initial Spider Women encounter, take the first right you see, and you'll arrive back at
the poison river where there's a second set of stepping stones similar to the one you just jumped across earlier. Jump on
these to find the secret alcove containing one or two checks depending on whether sub-weapons are randomized anywhere or not.

### Sun/Moon Doors

In total, there are six of these throughout the entire stage. One of them you are required to open in order to leave the stage,
while the other five lead to optional side rooms containing items. These are all very skippable in the vanilla game, but in a
rando context, it is obviously *very* important you learn where all of them are for when the day comes that a Hookshot
lands behind one! If it helps, two of them are before the gondolas, while all the rest are after them.

#### Lonesome bucket moon door
After you ride up on the second elevator, turn left at the first split path you see, and you will find, as I called it, the
"Lonesome bucket". Keep moving forward past this, and you will arrive at the moon door. The only thing of value, beside a shop
point, is a sub-weapon location. So if you don't have sub-weapons shuffled anywhere, you can very much skip this one.

#### Gondola rock crusher sun door
Once you get past the first poison pit that you are literally required to platform over, go forward at the next junction
instead of left (going left is progress and will take you to the rock crusher right before the gondolas). This door notably
hides two Roast Beefs normally, making it probably the most worthwhile one to visit in vanilla.

#### Corpse bucket moon door
After the poison pit immediately following the gondola ride, you will arrive at a bucket surrounded by corpses (hence the name).
Go left here, and you will arrive at this door.

#### Shovel zone moon door
On the straight path to the end-of-level sun door are two separate poison pits on the right that you can platform over.
Both of these lead to and from the same optional area, the "shovel zone" as I call it due to the random shovel you can find
here. Follow the path near the shovel that leads away from both poison pits, and you'll arrive at a junction with a save jewel.
Go straight on at this junction to arrive at this moon door. This particular one is more notable in Legacy of Darkness as it
contains one of the locations of Henry's children.

#### Shovel zone sun door
Same as the above moon door, but go left at the save jewel junction instead of straight.

### Invisible Items
#### Twin arrow signs
From the save point after the stepping stones following the initial Spider Women encounter, travel forward until you reach a
T-junction with two arrow signs at it. The right-pointing sign here contains an item on its post.

#### Near lonesome bucket
After riding the first upwards elevator following turning left at the twin arrow signs, you'll arrive at the lonesome bucket
area, with said bucket being found if you turn left at the first opportunity after said elevator. The item here is not
found *in* the bucket, but rather on a completely unmarked spot some meters from it. This had to have been a mistake,
seeing as Legacy moved it to actually be in the bucket.

#### Shovel
Can be found by taking either platforming course on the right side of the straightaway to the end after the gondolas.
This entire zone is noteable for the fact that there's no reason for Reinhardt to come here in either game; it's only ever
required for Henry to rescue one of his children.

### 3-Hit Breakables
#### Twin arrow signs rock
Turn right at the twin arrow signs junction, and you'll find this rock at the dead-end by the river. It contains a bunch of
healing and status items that translate into 5 rando checks.

#### Lonesome bucket poison pit rock
Near the lonesome bucket is the start of a platforming course over poison water that connects near Albert's campsite...which
you could reach anyway just by traveling forward at the prior junction instead of left. So what's the point of this poison
pit, then? Look out into the middle of it, and you'll see this rock on a tiny island out in the middle of it. If you choose
to take the hard way here, your reward will be three meat checks.



## Underground Waterway
#### Carrie Crawlspace
This is located shortly after the corridor following the ledges that let you reach the first waterfall's source alcove.
Notably, only Carrie is able to crouch and go through this, making these the only checks in the *entire* game that are
hard impossible without being a specific character. So if you have Carrie Logic on and your character is Reinhardt, you'll
have to hold L while loading into a map to change to Carrie just for this one secret. If Carrie Logic is off, then these
locations will not be added and you can just skip them entirely.

### 3-Hit Breakables
#### First poison parkour ledge
Near the start of the level is a series of ledges you can climb onto and platform across to reach a corner with a lantern
that you can normally get a Cure Ampoule from. The first of these ledges can be broken for an assortment of 6 things.

#### Inside skeleton crusher ledge
To the left of the hallway entrance leading to the third switch is a long shimmy-able ledge that you can grab onto and shimmy
for a whole eternity (I implemented a setting JUST to make shimmying this ledge faster!) to get to a couple stand on-able ledges,
one of which has a lantern above it containing a check. This ledge can be broken for 3 chickens. I'd highly suggest bringing
Holy Water for this because otherwise you're forced to break it from the other, lower ledge that's here. And this ledge
will drop endless crawling skeletons on you as long as you're on it.



## Castle Center
#### Atop elevator room machine
In the elevator room, right from the entrance coming in from the vampire triplets' room, is a machine that you can press
C-Right on to get dialog reading "An enormous machine." There's a torch on top of this machine that you can reach by
climbing onto the slanted part of the walls in the room.

#### Heinrich Meyer
The friendly lizard-man who normally gives you the Chamber Key in vanilla has a check for you just like Vincent.
Yes, he has a name! And you'd best not forget it!

#### Torture chamber rafters
A check can be found in the rafters in the room with the Mandragora shelf. Get onto and jump off the giant scythe or the
torture instrument shelf to make it up there. It's less annoying to do without Mandragora since having it will cause ghosts to
infinitely spawn in here.

### Invisible Items
#### Red carpet hall knight
The suit of armor in the red carpet hallway after the bottom elevator room, directly next to the door leading into the
Lizard Locker Room.

#### Lizard locker knight
The suit of armor in the Lizard Locker Room itself, directly across from the door connecting to the red carpet hallway.

#### Broken staircase knight
The suit of armor in the broken staircase room following the Lizard Locker Room.

#### Inside cracked wall hallway flamethrower
In the upper cracked wall hallway, it is in the lower flamethrower that is part of the pair between the Butler Bros. Room
and the main part of the hallway.

#### Nitro room crates
The wall of crates in the Nitro room on Heinrich Meyer's side. This is notable for being one of the very rare Healing Kits
that you can get for free in vanilla.

#### Hell Knight landing corner knight
The inactive suit of armor in the corner of the room before the Maid Sisters' Room, which also contains an active knight.

#### Maid sisters room vase
The lone vase in the vampire Maid Sisters' Room, directly across from the door leading to the Hell Knight Landing.
Yes, you are actually supposed to *check* this with C-right to get its item; not break it like you did to the pots in 
the Villa earlier!

#### Invention room giant Famicart
The giant square-shaped thing in one corner of the invention room that looks vaguely like a massive video game cartridge.
A Famicom cartridge, perhaps?

#### Invention room round machine
The brown circular machine in the invention room, close to the middle of the wall on the side of the Spike Crusher Room.

#### Inside nitro hallway flamethrower
The lower flamethrower in the hallway between the Nitro room from the Spike Crusher Room, near the two doors to said rooms.

#### Torture chamber instrument rack
The shelf full of torture instruments in the torture chamber, to the right of the Mandragora shelf.

### 3-Hit Breakables
#### Behemoth arena crate
This large crate can be found in the back-right corner of Behemoth's arena and is pretty hard to miss. Break it to get 5
moneybags-turned-checks.

#### Elevator room unoccupied statue stand
In the bottom elevator room is a statue on a stand that will cry literal Bloody Tears if you get near it. On the opposite
side of the room from this, near the enormous machine, is a stand much like the one the aforementioned statue is on only
this one is completely vacant. This stand can be broken for 3 roast beefs-turned checks.

#### Lizard locker room slab
In the Lizard Locker Room, on top of the second locker from the side of the room with the door to the red carpet hallway,
is a metallic box-like slab thingy that can be broken normally for 4 status items. This 3HB is notable for being one of two
funny ones in the game that does NOT set a flag when you break it in vanilla, meaning you can keep breaking it over and
over again for infinite Purifyings and Cure Ampoules!

### The Lizard Lockers
If you turned on the Lizard Locker Items setting, then hoo boy, you are in for a FUN =) time! Inside each one of the six Lizard
Lockers is a check, and the way you get these checks is by camping near each of the lockers as you defeat said Lizards,
praying that one will emerge from it and cause it to open to give you a chance to grab it. It is *completely* luck-based,
you have a 1-in-6 (around 16%) chance per Lizard-man that emerges, and you have to repeat this process six times for each
check inside each locker. You can open and cancel the warp menu to make things easier, but other than that, enjoy playing
with the Lizards!



## Duel Tower
#### Invisible bridge balcony
Located between Werewolf and Were-bull's arenas. Use an invisible bridge to reach it; it starts at the highest platform
on the same wall as it that appears after defeating Werewolf. The balcony contains two checks and a save point that I
added specifically for this rando to make the level less frustrating.

#### Above Were-bull arena
The only check that can be permanently missed in the vanilla game depending on the order you do things, not counting any
points of no return. Between Werewolf and Were-bull's arenas is an alternate path that you can take downward and around
to avoid Were-bull completely and get on top of his still-raised arena, so you can reach this. In the rando, I set it up so
that his arena will go back to being raised if you leave the area and come back, and if you get the item later his arena flag
will be set then. If you're playing with Dracula's bosses condition, then you can only get one Special2 off of him the first
time you beat him and then none more after that.



## Tower of Execution
#### Invisible bridge ledge
There are two ways to reach this one; use the invisible bridge that starts at the walkway above the entrance, or jump to
it from the Execution Key gate alcove. Collecting this Special2 in vanilla unlocks Reinhardt's alternate costume.

#### Guillotine tower top level
This iron maiden is strategically placed in such a way that you will very likely miss it if you aren't looking carefully for
it, so I am including it here. When you make it to the top floor of the level, as you approach the tower for the final time,
look on the opposite side of it from where you approach it, and you will find this. The laggiest check in the whole game!
I'd dare someone to find some check in some other Archipelago game that lags harder than this.

### 3-Hit Breakables
#### Pre-mid-savepoint platforms ledge
Here's a really weird one that even I never found about until well after I finished the 3HB setting and moved on to deving
other things, and I'd honestly be shocked if ANYONE knew about outside the context of this rando! This square-shaped
platform can be found right before the second set of expanding and retracting wall platforms, leading up to the mid-save
point, after going towards the central tower structure for the second time on the second floor. Breaking it will drop an
assortment of 5 items, one of which is notable for being the ONE sub-weapon that drops from a 3HB. This meant I had to really
change how things work to account for sub-weapons being in 3HBs!



## Tower of Science
#### Invisible bridge platform
Following the hallway with a save jewel beyond the Science Key2 door, look to your right, and you'll see this. Mind the
gap separating the invisible bridge from the solid ground of the bottom part of this section!

### 3-Hit Breakables
#### Invisible bridge platform crate
Near the candle on the above-mentioned invisible bridge platform is a small metallic crate. Break it for a total of 6
checks, which in vanilla are 2 chickens, moneybags, and jewels.



## Tower of Sorcery
#### Trick shot from mid-savepoint platform
From the platform with the save jewel, look back towards the vanishing red platforms that you had to conquer to get up
there, and you'll see a breakable diamond floating high above a solid platform before it. An ultra-precise orb shot from
Carrie can hit it to reveal the check, so you can then go down and get it. If you are playing as Reinhardt, you'll have
to use a sub-weapon. Any sub-weapon that's not Holy Water will work. Sub-weapons and the necessary jewels can both be
farmed off the local Icemen if it really comes down to it.

#### Above yellow bubble
Directly above the yellow bubble that you break to raise the middle yellow large platform. Jump off the final red platform
in the series of red platforms right after the save point when said platform bobs all the way up, and you'll be able to
hit this diamond with good timing.

#### Above tiny blue platforms start
Above the large platform after the yellow ones from whence you can reach the first of the series of tiny blue platforms.
This diamond is low enough that you can reach it by simply jumping straight up to it.

#### Invisible bridge platform
Located at the very end of the stage, off to the side. Use the invisible bridge to reach it. The Special2 that unlocks
Carrie's costume can be normally found here (or Special3, depending on if you are playing the PAL version or not).



## Clock Tower
All the normal items here and in Room of Clocks are self-explanatory, but the 3HBs in Clock Tower are a whoooooooole 'nother story. So buckle up...

### 3-Hit Breakables
#### Gear climb room battery underside slab
In the first room, on the side you initially climb up, go up until you find a battery-like object that you can stand on
as a platform. From the platform right after this, you can hit this 3HB that can be found on the underside of the structure
in the corner, above the structure before the first set of gears that you initially start the climb on. 3 chickens/checks
can be gotten out of this one.

#### Gear climb room door underside slab
Now THIS one can be very annoying to get, doubly so if you're playing as Reinhardt, triply so if you're playing Hard Mode
on top of that because you will also have to deal with invincible, bone-throwing red skeletons here! This slab can be
found on the underside of the platform in the first room with the door leading out into the second area and drops 3
beefs/checks when you break it. Carrie is small enough to crouch under the platform and shoot the thing a few times
without *too* much hassle, but the only way I know of for Reinhardt to get it is to hang him off the side of the gear
and pull him up once he gets moved under the platform. Getting him to then face the breakable and whip it without falling
off due to the gear's rotation is next-to-impossible, I find, so the safest method to breaking it as him is to just rush
it with his sword, go back up, repeat 2 more times. Pray the aftermentioned Hard Mode skellies don't decide to cause *too*
much trouble during all of this!

#### Final room entrance slab
Simply next to the entrance when you come into the third and final room from the intended way. Drops 2 moneybags-turned-checks,
which funnily normally have their item IDs shared with the other 3HB in this room's items, so I had to separate those for
the rando.

#### Renon's final offers slab
At the top of the final room, on a platform near the Renon contract that would normally be the very last in the game.
This 3HB drops a whopping 8 items, more than any other 3HB in the entire game, and 6 of those are all moneybags. They
*really* shower you in gold in preparation for the finale, huh?



## Castle Keep
#### Behind Dracula's chamber/Dracula's floating cube
This game continues the CV tradition of having a hidden secret around Dracula's chamber that you can get helpful things
from before the final battle begins. Jump onto the torch ledges and use the thin walkway to reach the backside of Dracula's
chamber where these can both be found. The floating cube, in question, can be reached with an invisible bridge. The other
candle here is noteworthy for being the sole jewel candle in vanilla that doesn't set a flag, meaning you can keep going
back down and up the stairs to farm infinite sub-weapon ammo for Dracula like in old school Castlevania!

### Invisible Items
#### Left/Right Dracula door flame
Inside the torches on either side of the door to Dracula's chamber. Similar to the above-mentioned jewel torch, these do
not set flags. So you can get infinite healing kits for free by constantly going down and back up!
