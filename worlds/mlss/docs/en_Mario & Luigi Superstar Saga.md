# Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and
export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Items which the player would normally acquire throughout the game have been moved around. Logic remains, so the game is
always able to be completed, but because of the item shuffle, the player may need to access certain areas before they
would in the vanilla game.

The game has been changed to an open-world style as opposed to the linear style the vanilla game has.

Other Features such as Turbo through textboxes (Hold L/R+A) and Pipe Warping from any room (Hold L+R+SELECT) have been added for convenience.

Enemies and Bosses can be randomized, and there stats can scaled to feel more the vanilla games stats.

Other aspects of the game can be randomized as well such as music, sounds, battle backgrounds, Mario and Luigis Colors, and more.

## What is the goal of Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga when randomized?

Defeat Cackletta's Soul in Bowser's Castle. This requires you to collect all 4 beanstar pieces and restore the beanstar, as well as Peach's Extra Dress and the Fake beanstar, and bring them to Fawful at the end of Jokes End. This also requires Ultra Hammers, Thunder Hand and Green Pearl Bean, Fire Hand and Red Pearl Bean, Green Goblet, The Beanbean Brooch, All 3 Chuckola Fruits, Peasley's Rose, and either the Membership card or Red Goblet.

Items in a shop from another player's world will display the player name and item name in addition to being displayed as an AP Item.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

Items will be placed directly into the players inventory after a few seconds. Sometimes for certain events and cutscenes to be properly triggered right after you recieved an item, you may have to leave and re-enter the room to properly load everything required for the respective event or cutscene.
