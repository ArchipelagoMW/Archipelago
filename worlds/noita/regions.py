# Oh, what a tangled web we weave
# Notes to create artificial spheres:
# - Shaft is excluded to disconnect Mines from the Snowy Depths
# - Lukki Lair is disconnected from The Vault
# - Overgrown Cavern is connected to the Underground Jungle instead of the Desert due to similar difficulty
# - Powerplant is disconnected from the Sandcave due to difficulty and sphere creation
# - Snow Chasm is disconnected from the Snowy Wasteland
# - Pyramid is connected to the Hiisi Base instead of the Desert due to similar difficulty
# - Frozen Vault is connected to the Vault instead of the Snowy Wasteland due to similar difficulty
# - Lake is connected to The Laboratory, since the bosses are hard without specific set-ups (which means late game)
# - Snowy Depths connects to Lava Lake orb since you need digging for it, so fairly early is acceptable
# - Ancient Laboratory is connected to the Coal Pits, so that Ylialkemisti isn't sphere 1
