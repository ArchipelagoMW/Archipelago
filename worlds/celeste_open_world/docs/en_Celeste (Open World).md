# Celeste Open World

## What is this game?

**Celeste (Open World)** is a  Randomizer for the original Celeste. In this acclaimed platformer created by ExOK Games, you control Madeline as she attempts to climb the titular mountain, meeting friends and obstacles along the way.
This randomizer takes an "Open World" approach. All of your active areas are open to you from the start. Progression is found in unlocking the ability to interact with various objects in the areas, such as springs, traffic blocks, feathers, and many more. One area can be selected as your "Goal Area", requiring you to clear that area before you can access the Epilogue and finish the game. Additionally, you can be required to receive a customizable amount of `Strawberry` items to access the Epilogue and optionally to access your Goal Area as well.
There are a variety of progression, location, and aesthetic options available. Please be safe on the climb.

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

By default, the Prologue, the A-Side levels for Chapters 1-7, and the Epilogue are included in the randomizer. Using options, B- and C-Sides can also be included, as can the Core and Farewell chapters. One level is chosen via an option to be the "Goal Area". Obtaining the required amount of Strawberry items from the multiworld and clearing this Goal Area will grant access to the Epilogue and the Credits, which is the goal of the randomizer.
