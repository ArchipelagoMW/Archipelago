# Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories Randomizer Setup Guide

## Important

As we are using BizHawk, this guide is only applicable to Windows and Linux systems.

## Required Software
- BizHawk: [BizHawk Releases from TASVideos](https://tasvideos.org/BizHawk/ReleaseHistory)
  - Detailed installation instructions for BizHawk can be found at the above link.
  - Windows users must run the prereq installer first, which can also be found at the above link.
- The built-in Archipelago client, which can be installed [here](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases)
- A Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories (US) ROM file. The Archipelago community cannot provide this.

## Configuring your YAML file

### What is a YAML file and why do I need one?

Your YAML file contains a set of configuration options which provide the generator with information about how it should
generate your game. Each player of a multiworld will provide their own YAML file. This setup allows each player to enjoy
an experience customized for their taste, and different players in the same multiworld can all have different options.

### Where do I get a YAML file?

You can customize your settings by visiting the [Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories Settings Page](/games/Kingdom%20Hearts%20Chain%20of%20Memories/player-settings).
