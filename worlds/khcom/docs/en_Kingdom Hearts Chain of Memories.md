# Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories (GBA)

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains most of the options you need to 
configure and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

The Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories Randomizer will remove from your inventory cards you pick up in the overworld, moogle shops, and as rewards from boss battles.

The entire castle is open from the start after completing Traverse Town.  Floors you haven't unlocked are assigned Traverse Town, otherwise they will be assigned normally.

You start with Key of Beginnings, Key of Guidance, and Key to Truth for Floor 1 in your inventory.

Your goal is find all 7 friend cards (Aladdin, Ariel, Beast, Donald, Goofy, Jack, Peter Pan).

## What items and locations get shuffled?

###Items

Items which unlock each world, Key to Rewards for each floor, and Enemy Cards may be shuffled into the item pool.  In addition, card packs or card sets may be included as well. 

Card sets are comprised of a card type and a value range.  For example, you might receive Blizzard 4-6, which means you receive Blizzard 4, Blizzard 5, and Blizzard 6.

Card packs are the other way to receive cards in the randomizer and include a predefined number of cards which vary in strength depending on the card pack tier; Bronze, Silver, or Gold.

###Locations

Journal entries are locations, including story, heartless, and battle card entries (discluding enemy cards).


## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any of the items which can be shuffled may also be placed into another player's world. It is possible to choose to limit
certain items to your own world.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

When the player receives an item, your client will display a message displaying the item you have obtained.
