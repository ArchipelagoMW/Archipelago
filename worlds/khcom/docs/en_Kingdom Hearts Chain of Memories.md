# Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories (GBA)

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains most of the options you need to 
configure and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

The Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories Randomizer will take removes cards you pick up in the overworld, moogle shops, and as rewards from boss battles and sends the event as a check.

The first time you acquire a card in any way listed above for the first time, you or another player will receive an item.

Locations where you receive a Key of Beginnings, Key of Guidance, or Key to Truth are also checks.

Key of Beginnings, Key of Guidance, Key to Truth, and Key of Rewards are now all assigned floors, meaning you can have a Key of Beginnings for Floor 5 but not Floor 8 for example.

The entire castle is open from the start after completing Traverse Town.  Floors for which you do not have the Key of Beginnings for are assigned Traverse Town, otherwise they will be assigned normally.

You start with Key of Beginnings, Key of Guidance, and Key to Truth for Floor 1 in your inventory.

Your goal is find all 7 friend cards (Aladdin, Ariel, Beast, Donald, Goofy, Jack, Peter Pan).

## What items and locations get shuffled?

In addition to the Key of Beginnings, Key of Guidance, Key to Truth, and Key to Rewards for each floor, card packs are shuffled into the item pool.
