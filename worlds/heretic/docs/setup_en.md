# Heretic Randomizer Setup

## Required Software

- [Heretic (e.g. Steam version)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2390/Heretic_Shadow_of_the_Serpent_Riders/)
- [Archipelago Crispy DOOM](https://github.com/Daivuk/apdoom/releases) (Same download for DOOM 1993, DOOM II and Heretic)

## Optional Software

- [ArchipelagoTextClient](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases)

## Installing APDoom
1. Download [APDOOM.zip](https://github.com/Daivuk/apdoom/releases) and extract it.
2. Copy HERETIC.WAD from your steam install into the extracted folder.
   You can find the folder in steam by finding the game in your library,
   right clicking it and choosing *Manageâ†’Browse Local Files*.

## Joining a MultiWorld Game

1. Launch apdoom-launcher.exe
2. Choose Heretic in the dropdown
3. Enter the Archipelago server address, slot name, and password (if you have one)
4. Press "Launch Game"
5. Enjoy!

To continue a game, follow the same connection steps.
Connecting with a different seed won't erase your progress in other seeds.

## Archipelago Text Client

We recommend having Archipelago's Text Client open on the side to keep track of what items you receive and send.
APDOOM has in-game messages,
but they disappear quickly and there's no reasonable way to check your message history in-game.

### Hinting

To hint from in-game, use the chat (Default key: 'T'). Hinting from Heretic can be difficult because names are rather long and contain special characters. For example:
```
!hint The River of Fire (E2M3) - Green key
```
The game has a hint helper implemented, where you can simply type this:
```
!hint e2m3 green
```
For this to work, include the map short name (`E1M1`), followed by one of the keywords: `map`, `blue`, `yellow`, `green`.

## Auto-Tracking

APDOOM has a functional map tracker integrated into the level select screen.
It tells you which levels you have unlocked, which keys you have for each level, which levels have been completed,
and how many of the checks you have completed in each level.
