# Heretic

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page](../player-options) contains the options needed to configure your game session.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Weapons, keys, and level unlocks have been randomized. Monsters and Pickups are also randomized. Typically, you will end up playing different levels out of order to find your keys and level unlocks and eventually complete your game.

Maps can be selected on a level select screen. You can exit a level at any time by visiting the hub station at the beginning of each level. The state of each level is saved and restored upon re-entering the level.

## What is the goal?

The goal is to complete every level in the episodes you have chosen to play.

## What is a "check" in The Heretic?

Weapons, keys, and powerups have been replaced with Archipelago checks. Some have been selectively removed because Heretic contains a lot of collectibles. Usually when many bunch together, one was kept. The switch at the end of each level is also a check.

## What "items" can you unlock in Heretic?

Keys and level unlocks are your main progression items. Weapon unlocks and some upgrades are your useful items. Powerups, ammo, healing, and armor are filler items.
