# Heretic

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page](../player-options) contains the options needed to configure your game session.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Weapons, keys, and level unlocks have been randomized and are placed into the multiworld item pool. Typically, you will end up playing different levels out of order to find your keys and level unlocks and eventually complete your game.

Maps can be selected on a level select screen. You can exit a level at any time by visiting the hub station at the beginning of each level. The state of each level (items collected, monsters killed, etc.) is saved and restored upon re-entering the level.

Optionally, monsters and smaller pickups may be shuffled or randomized, for a more unique experience.

## What is the goal?

The default goal is to complete every level in every episode you have chosen to play; there are other alternative goals available that involve clearing a specific set or amount of levels in total, however.

At any time, you can check the status of your goal by selecting "Goals" in the main menu of the game.

## What is a "check" in Heretic?

All weapons, keys, artifacts, and powerups are removed from levels and replaced with Archipelago checks. By default, some locations have been removed (usually in areas with large bunches of items) to reduce the total check count.

## What "items" can you unlock in Heretic?

Weapons, keys and level unlocks are your main progression items. Artifacts and other capacity upgrades are your useful items. Ammo, healing, and armor are filler items.
