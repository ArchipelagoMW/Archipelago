## What is this game?

~~Clique is a psychological survival horror game where a player must survive the temptation to press red buttons.~~

Clique is a joke game developed for Archipelago in March 2023 to showcase how easy it can be to develop a world for
Archipelago. The objective of the game is to press the big red button. If a player is playing on `hard_mode`, they must
wait for someone else in the multiworld to "activate" their button before they can press it.

Clique can be played on most modern HTML5-capable browsers.
