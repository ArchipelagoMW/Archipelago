# Clique Start Guide

After rolling your seed, go to the [Clique Game](http://clique.pharware.com/) site and enter the server details, your 
slot name, and a room password if one is required. Then click "Connect".

If you're playing on "easy mode", just click the button and receive "Satisfaction".

If you're playing on "hard mode", you may need to wait for activation before you can complete your objective. Luckily, 
Clique runs in most major browsers that support HTML5, so you can load Clique on your phone and be productive while 
you wait!

If you need some ideas for what to do while waiting for button activation, give the following a try:

- Clean your room.
- Wash the dishes.
- Get some food from a non-descript fast food restaurant.
- Do the daily Wordle.
- ~~Sell your soul to Phar.~~
- Do your school work.


~~If you run into any issues with this game, definitely do not contact **thephar** on discord. *wink* *wink*~~
