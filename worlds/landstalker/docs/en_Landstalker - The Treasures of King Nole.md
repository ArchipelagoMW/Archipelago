# Landstalker: The Treasures of King Nole

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains most of the options you need to 
configure and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

All items are shuffled while keeping a logic to make every seed completable.

Some key items could be obtained in a very different order compared to the vanilla game, leading to very unusual situations.

The world is made as open as possible while keeping the original locks behind the same items & triggers as vanilla 
when that makes sense logic-wise. This puts the emphasis on exploration and gameplay by removing all the scenario
and story-related triggers, giving a wide open world to explore.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

All items and locations are shuffled. This includes **chests**, items on **ground**, in **shops**, and given by **NPCs**.

It's also worth noting that all of these items are shuffled among all worlds, meaning every item can be sent to you 
by other players.

## What are the main differences compared to the vanilla game?

The **Key** is now a unique item and can open several doors without being consumed, making it a standard progression item. 
All key doors are gone, except three of them :
  - the Mercator castle backdoor (giving access to Greenmaze sector)
  - Thieves Hideout middle door (cutting the level in half)
  - King Nole's Labyrinth door near entrance

---

The secondary shop of Mercator requiring to do the traders sidequest in the original game is now unlocked by having
**Buyer Card** in your inventory.

You will need as many **jewels** as specified in the options to use the teleporter to go to Kazalt and the final dungeon.
If you find and use the **Lithograph**, it will tell you in which world are each one of your jewels.

Each seed, there is a random dungeon which is chosen to be the "dark dungeon" where you won't see anything unless you
have the **Lantern** in your inventory. Unlike vanilla, King Nole's Labyrinth no longer has the few dark rooms the lantern
was originally intended for.

The **Statue of Jypta** is introduced as a real item (instead of just being an intro gimmick) and gives you gold over 
time while you're walking, the same way Healing Boots heal you when you walk.


## What do I need to know for my first seed?

It's advised you keep Massan as your starting region for your first seed, since taking another starting region might 
be significantly harder, both combat-wise and logic-wise.

Having fully open & shuffled teleportation trees is an interesting way to play, but is discouraged for beginners 
as well since it can force you to go in late-game zones with few Life Stocks.

Overall, the default options are good for a beginner-friendly seed, and if you don't feel too confident, you can also
lower the combat difficulty to make it more forgiving.

*Have fun on your adventure!*
