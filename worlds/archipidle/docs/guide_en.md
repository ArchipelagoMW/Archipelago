# ArchipIdle Setup Guide

## Joining a MultiWorld Game
1. Generate a `.yaml` file from the [ArchipIDLE Player Settings Page](/games/ArchipIDLE/player-settings)
2. Open the ArchipIDLE Client in your web browser by either:
    - Navigate to the [ArchipIDLE Client](http://idle.multiworld.link)
    - Download the client and run it locally from the
      [ArchipIDLE GitHub Releases Page](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/archipidle/releases)
3. Enter the server address in the `Server Address` field and press enter
4. Enter your slot name when prompted. This should be the same as the `name` you entered on the
   setting page above, or the `name` field in your yaml file.
5. Click the "Begin!" button.
