# ArchipIDLE

## What is this game?

ArchipIDLE is the 2022 Archipelago April Fools' Day joke. It is an idle game that "finds an item" every
thirty seconds, up to **100 in total**. (Some of the items are for itself.) In a multiworld, other players
can also find items for ArchipIDLE.

There is no player control over ArchipIDLE; the game plays itself.

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure
and export a config file.
