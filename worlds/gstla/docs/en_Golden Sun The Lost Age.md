# Golden Sun The Lost Age

## Where is the options page?

You can read through all the options and generate a YAML [here](../player-options).

## What does randomization do to this game?

This randomizer handles item randomization, psynergy randomization, character randomization, summon randomization and djinn randomization.
Many options from the base Golden Sun The Lost Age Randomizer are supported in Archipelago and can be enjoyed. Minor adjuments are made to ensure they work well in a multiworld setting.
Feel free to visit [options page](../player-options) for a more comprehensive list of what can be changed.

## What items and locations get randomized?

There are few things to look out for such as:
- Key items such as Magma Ball or Dancing Idol
- Psynergy such as Reveal or Douse
- Summon tablets found throughout the game
- Djinn (local only on djinn spots)
- Characters
- Chests
- Visible items on the floor such as the Laughing Fungus
- Hidden items in pots/barrls
- Hidden items that are dug underground or under a bunch of leaves

## What other changes are made to the game?

There are many quality of life improvements meant to speed up the game a little and improve the experience of playing a
randomizer. Here are some of the more important ones:

- Using Retreat on the Overworld will allow you to use Teleport Psynergy for quick travel.
- Ship overworld speed is increased.
- Most cutscenes are skipped or sped up.
- Many more minor improvementsâ€¦, most togglable by setting.

## Where is my starting inventory?

Upon starting the game the items should be received when connected with the client and the server.

## What does another world's item look like in Golden Sun The Lost Age?

When you find an item that is not your own, you will see an Archipelago Icon and Felix will pick it up as per the vanilla game.
The item will disappear and the location should be checked. Unfortunatley you do not see the name of the item or person receiving the item in the game.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

You will only receive items while outside of battles. When your inventory is full no more items will be granted unless space is made available.
To help reduce issues with inventory management the Psynergy items such as Douse Drop are instead learned as Psynergy directly instead of given as an item. 

## Can I play offline?

Yes, the client and connector are only necessary for sending and receiving items. If you're playing a solo game, you
don't need to play online unless you want the rest of Archipelago's functionality (like hints and auto-tracking). If
you're playing a multiworld game, the client will sync your game with the server the next time you connect.
