# Stardew Valley Randomizer Setup Guide

## Required Hardward
- A computer
- A keyboard or controller
- A screen
- A source of power
- An internet connection (optional)
- Infinite free time

## Required Software

- Stardew Valley on PC (Recommended: [Steam version](https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/))
    - You need version 1.5.6. It is available in a public beta branch on Steam ![image](https://i.imgur.com/uKAUmF0.png).
    - If your Stardew is not on Steam, you are responsible for finding a way to downgrade it.
    - This measure is temporary. We are working hard to bring the mod to Stardew 1.6 as soon as possible.
- SMAPI 3.x.x ([Mod loader for Stardew Valley](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2400?tab=files))
    - Same as Stardew Valley itself, SMAPI needs a slightly older version to be compatible with Stardew Valley 1.5.6 ![image](https://i.imgur.com/kzgObHy.png)
- [StardewArchipelago Mod Release 5.x.x](https://github.com/agilbert1412/StardewArchipelago/releases)
    - It is important to use a mod release of version 5.x.x to play seeds that have been generated here. Later releases 
  can only be used with later releases of the world generator, that are not hosted on archipelago.gg yet.

## Optional Software
- I highly recommend Notepad++, Winrar and Clippy

## Configuring your YAML file

### Where do I get a YAML file?

If you ask nicely, I'm sure the host can give you one

If not, try to ask less nicely

## Joining a MultiWorld Game

### Installing the mod

I made the mod, so it's mine. Make your own.

### Playing with supported mods

See the [Supported mods documentation](https://github.com/agilbert1412/StardewArchipelago/blob/5.x.x/Documentation/Supported%20Mods.md)

### Multiplayer

Please stop asking, *I'm begging you*.
