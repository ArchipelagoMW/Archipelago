# Stardew Valley

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?
A vast number of optional objectives in stardew valley can be shuffled around the multiworld. Most of these are optional, and the player can customize their experience in their YAML file.

For these objectives, if they have a vanilla reward, this reward will instead be an item in the multiworld. For the remaining number of such objectives, there are a number of "Resource Pack" items, which are simply a stack of an item that may be useful to the player.

## What is the goal of Stardew Valley?
The player can choose from a number of goals, using their YAML settings.
- Complete the Community Center
- Succeed Grandpa's Evaluation with 4 lit candles
- Reach the bottom of the Pelican Town Mineshaft
- Complete the "Cryptic Note" quest, by meeting Mr Qi on floor 100 of the Skull Cavern
- Get the achievement "Master Angler", which requires catching every fish in the game

## What are location check in Stardew Valley?
Location checks in Stardew Valley always include:
- Community Center Bundles
- Mineshaft chest rewards
- Story Quests
- Traveling Merchant items
- Isolated objectives such as the beach bridge, Old Master Cannoli, Grim Reaper Statue, etc

There also are a number of location checks that are optional, and individual players choose to include them or not in their shuffling:
- Tools and Fishing Rod Upgrades
- Carpenter Buildings
- Backpack Upgrades
- Mine elevator levels
- Skill Levels
- Arcade Machines
- Help Wanted quests
- Fishsanity: Catching individual fish

## Which items can be in another player's world?
Every normal reward from the above locations can be in another player's world.
For the locations which do not include a normal reward, Resource Packs are instead added to the pool. These can contain ores, seeds, fertilizers, warp totems, etc.
There are a few extra items, which are added to the pool but do not have a matching location. These include
- Wizard Buildings
- Return Scepter

And lastly, some archipelago-exclusive items exist in the pool, which are designed around game balance and QoL. These include:
- Arcade Machine buffs (Only if the arcade machines are randomized)
- Permanent Movement Speed Bonuses (customizable)
- Permanent Luck Bonuses (customizable)
- Traveling Merchant buffs

## When the player receives an item, what happens?
Since Pelican Town is a remote area, it takes one business day for every item to reach the player. If an item is received while online, it will appear in the player's mailbox the next morning, with a message from the sender telling them where it was found.
If an item is received while offline, it will be in the mailbox as soon as the player logs in.

## Multiplayer

You cannot play an Archipelago Slot in multiplayer at the moment. There is no short-terms plans to support that feature.

You can, however, send Stardew Valley objects as gifts from one Stardew Player to another Stardew player, using in-game Joja Prime delivery, for a fee. This exclusive feature can be turned off if you don't want to send and receive gifts.
