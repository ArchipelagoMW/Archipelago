## Which items can be in another player's world?

Joja Cola, mostly

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

Since Pelican Town is a remote area, it takes one business day for every item to reach the player. If an item is received 
while online, it will appear in the player's mailbox the next morning, with a message from the sender telling them where 
it was found. If an item is received while offline, it will be in the mailbox as soon as the player logs in.

Some items will be directly attached to the letter, while some others will instead be a world-wide unlock, and the letter 
only serves to tell the player about it.

In some cases, like receiving Carpenter and Wizard buildings, the player will still need to go ask Robin to construct the 
building that they have received, so they can choose its position. This construction will be completely free.

## Mods

Don't bother, it takes computer literacy to install mods. You don't have it in you.

## Multiplayer

Please stop asking, *I'm begging you*.
