## Setup

To install the Archipelago mod, you can use a mod manager like 
[r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/bomb-rush-cyberfunk/p/ebkr/r2modman/), or install manually by following these steps:

1. Download and install [BepInEx 5.4.22 x64](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.22) in your Bomb Rush 
Cyberfunk root folder. *Do not use any pre-release versions of BepInEx 6.*

2. Start Bomb Rush Cyberfunk once so that BepInEx can create its required configuration files.

3. Download the zip archive from the [releases](https://github.com/TRPG0/BRC-Archipelago/releases) page, and extract its 
contents into `BepInEx\plugins`.

After installing Archipelago, there are some additional mods that can also be installed for a better experience:
