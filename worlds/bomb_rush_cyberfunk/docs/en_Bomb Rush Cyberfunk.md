## What does randomization do in this game?

The goal of Bomb Rush Cyberfunk randomizer is to defeat all rival crews in each borough of New Amsterdam, but several 
changes have been made to the game for a better experience as a randomizer:

- The prelude in the police station can be skipped.
- The map for each stage is always unlocked.
- The taxi is always unlocked, but you will still need to visit each stage's taxi stop before you can use them.
- No M, L, or XL graffiti is unlocked at the beginning.
- All characters except Red are locked.
- REP is no longer earned from doing graffiti and is instead earned by finding it randomly in the world.
- One single REP count is used throughout the game, instead of having separate totals for each stage. REP requirements 
are the same as the original game, but added together in order. At least 960 REP is needed to finish the game.

Items can be found by picking up any type of collectible, unlocking characters, taking pictures of Polo, and for every 
5 graffiti spots tagged. The types of items that can be found are Music, Graffiti (M), Graffiti (L), Graffiti (XL), 
Skateboards, Inline Skates, BMX, Outifts, Characters, REP, and the Camera.

The mod also adds two new apps to the phone, an "Encounter" app which lets you give up on certain encounters early, and 
the "Archipelago" app which lets you view chat messages and change some options while playing.
