# Final Fantasy IV: Free Enterprise

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

From the Free Enterprise website:

>In Free Enterprise, you are given the airship at the beginning of the game, and you may complete whatever quests are 
>available to you in any order. Further, the Pass opens a passage in Toroia that will take you directly to Zeromus, 
>whenever you are ready to defeat him. 
>Additional options allow for randomization of key items, characters, treasures, shops, and more. 
>There are some important gameplay changes from the original game to note; the NPCs in the training room cover the 
>essentials, and a full detailed list of Free Enterprise's changes can be found at 
>the [Free Enterprise Wiki](https://wiki.ff4fe.com/).

Additionally, the Archipelago version of the randomizer adds in a couple of additional changes: 

- Key Items may be located anywhere,
- Monster-In-A-Box chests now include an additional item to incentivize checking them.
- Up to thirty-two objectives may be included when generating a game.

## What is the goal of Final Fantasy IV: Free Enterprise when randomized?

By default, the goal is to locate the Crystal and get to Zeromus and defeat him, either through the Pass item or by
proceding through the Lunar Subterrane. When objectives are enabled, clearing them can be set to reward the Crystal
or to clear the game outright, skipping Zeromus entirely.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

All 399 treasure locations (chests, pots, hidden items) and forty-three event reward locations have been shuffled, and
all items available in Final Fantasy IV: Free Enterprise are possibilities to appear in the item pool.

Characters are shuffled amongst their normal recruitment locations.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any key item, piece of gear, or consumable item can appear in another world.

## What does another world's item look like in Final Fantasy IV: Free Enterprise

All items are unknown until earned, at which point the ingame text box will describe what has ben obtained or sent.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

Items are placed directly into the inventory as long as the player is not in battle, in a cutscene, or the menu. 
If no slots are available, items will not be sent until room is made using the ingame Trash functionality.
