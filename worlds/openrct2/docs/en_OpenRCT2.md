## How Does Randomizer Work in this game?

The Archipelago Randomizer places every ride, scenery item, and (optionally) park restriction behind a large shop. Players can unlock items in the shop by buying them, unlocking different trees and goodies around every corner. Beware though, some shop items require certain rides to be built, and some require pleasing the Elder Gods themselves.

Players may choose their own goal, multiple goals, or leave it up to the randomizer. Goals include paying off the park loan, obtaining a certain number of guests, building roller coasters, or even new goals, such as buying all the land on the map!

## Items

Rides, scenery, rules, and a variety of new items have been placed in the unlock shop.
