## What is this game?

shapez is an automation game about cutting, rotating, stacking, and painting shapes, that you extract from randomly
generated patches on an infinite canvas, and sending them to the hub to complete levels. The "tutorial", where you
unlock a new building or game mechanic (almost) every level, goes until level 26, where you unlock freeplay with 
infinitely more levels, that require a new, randomly generated shape.

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure
and export a config file.
