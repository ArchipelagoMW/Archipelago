Items:
- buildings
- other game mechanics normally unlocked by levels
- speed upgrades (some bigger than others)
- Copy paste shapes (filler for additional checks)
@code: just execute code when package received, look at vanilla code to know how to give those
    items, receiving buildings and other mechanics flips a boolean, speed upgrades add to speed, copy
    paste shapes add to inventory (look at what happens when shape delivered to hub)
@generating: minimum 25 levels (+2 additional checks) and 4x7 upgrades contain all game mechanics
    and 28 x1 upgrades, additional upgrades (always packs of four) contain x.1 upgrades, softlock and
    long play time achievements contain additional x1 upgrades or fillers if not fitting, reasonable
    achievements contain random copy paste shape bundles and x.1 upgrades (aka fillers)

Traps:
- draining inventory (can replace filler)
@code: see items
@generating: replace filler items for optional locations

Locations:
- All 25 Levels before goal (or even more), double checks for levels 1 and 20
@code: override level up method, use different cases for different options, override info screen
- optional reasonable achievements (32)
- optional softlock achievements (6) with only normal, trap, or useful items
- optional long play time achievements (2) with only normal, trap, or useful items
- 5 achievements MUST BE EXCLUDED
@code: achievements probably not gathered in a single place, complete override to not get steam achievements
- upgrades up to level 8 (or even more)
@code: override button actions

Goals
- Vanilla (Complete level 26)
- Meta (Complete a specified level after level 26, additional achievements as checks)
@code: when overriding level up method: if level=goal then goal
- Even fasterer (Have all upgrades over a specified tier after 8)
@code: same but in upgrade button overriding
- Efficiency III (Deliver 500 blueprint shapes / second to the hub)
@code: look into similar achievement

Additional Randomization:
- level completion Shapes
- upgrade Shapes
- vanilla toggle in Options
- complete random toggle in options
- progressive machine requirements (level 1-3 need only one machine,â€¦), can be toggeled to vanilla, can be
    toggeled to stretching
@code: look at vanilla levels after 26

Logical requirements:
- vertical half shapes > cutter
- horizontal half/quarter shapes > cutter, rotator
- shapes with different parts > cutter, stacker, rotator
- stacked shapes > stacker
- red, green, blue shapes > painter
- more colored shapes > painter, mixer
- goal > cutter, stacker, painter, mixer, balancer, rotator, tunnel, blueprints
- upgrades access > upgrades unlocker

Region connections:
- Menu
- one for each row of levels with new kind of shape (6), connects to lower region, lowest connects to menu
- goal, connects to highest levels region
- upgrades tier 2
- upgrades tier 3-9+, connects to lower tier

@code Connection details:
- save login details in save file
- connect when loading save file, so not different overriding for different cases
- add login input box on main menu, creating save file takes that input, cancel loading file when no connection
- close connection on returning to main menu
- add button to save file in Main menu to change login details
- if connection lost, save the game and return to main menu
- load all items received offline
- save ordered list of received items in save file
- save index of last received item in save file
- playing offline is a nice idea but NOT PLANNED for initial release
- receive AP seed and buildings order logic from server and use them to generate the save file

@code other details:
- no console input, need text client
- active mod = only playing AP
