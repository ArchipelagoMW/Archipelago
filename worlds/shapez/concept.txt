Items:
- buildings
- other game mechanics normally unlocked by levels
- speed upgrades (x1 as useful, x0.1 as filler for additional checks)
- Copy paste shapes (filler for additional checks)
@code: just execute code when package received, look at vanilla code to know how to give those
    items, receiving buildings and other mechanics flips a boolean, speed upgrades add to speed, copy
    paste shapes add to inventory (look at what happens when shape delivered to hub)
@generating: minimum 25 levels (+2 additional checks) and 4x7 upgrades contain all game mechanics
    and 28 x1 upgrades, additional upgrades contain x.1 upgrades, reasonable
    achievements contain random copy paste shape bundles and x.1 upgrades (aka fillers)

Traps:
- draining inventory (can replace filler)
@code: see items
@generating: replace filler items for optional locations

Locations:
- All 25 Levels before goal (or even more), double checks for levels 1 and 20
@code: override level up method, use different cases for different options, override info screen
- upgrades up to tier VIII (or even more), double checks for all tier II upgrades
@code: override button actions
- optional reasonable achievements (36)
- optional softlock achievements (6) with only normal, trap, or useful items
- optional long play time achievements (2) with only normal, trap, or useful items
- activate darkmode achievement MUST BE EXCLUDED
- shapesanity
@code: achievements probably not gathered in a single place, complete override to not get steam achievements

Goals
- Vanilla (Complete level 26)
- Mam (Complete a specified level after level 26, additional achievements as checks)
@code: when overriding level up method: if level=goal then goal
- Even fasterer (Have all upgrades over a specified tier after 8)
@code: same but in upgrade button overriding
- Efficiency III (Deliver 500 blueprint shapes / second to the hub)
@code: look into similar achievement

Options:
- goal:
    vanilla (level 26),
    mam (level >26, additional achievements),
    even fasterer (all upgrades at specific tier >8),
    efficiency III (500 blueprint shapes / second)
- goal amount (range 9-1000, error if meta with <27)
- required amount of delivered shapes multiplier (range 1 to 100, divided by 10)
- randomize level requirements (boolean)
- progressive level requirements (only if randomized level requirements):
    vanilla (1 free, 2-4 cutter, 5-6 rotator, 7-8 painter, 9-10 mixer, 11+ stacker),
    shuffled (order of all 5 buildings shuffled, afflicted levels stay the same),
    stretched vanilla (all 6 phases being floor(maxlevel/6) levels long (last one being a bit longer) with same order),
    stretched shuffled (like stretched vanilla, but shuffled),
    hardcore (all complete random except level 1)
- randomize upgrade requirements (boolean)
- progressive upgrade requirements (only if randomized upgrade requirements):
    vanilla-like (2 free, 3 random building #12/#12/#1/#123, 4+ all),
    linear (2 free, 3-6 each another random building, 7+ all),
    hardcore (all complete random except all tier 2 upgrades)
- same late upgrade requirements (boolean, only if randomized upgrade requirements)
- include achievements
- exclude lang play time achievements
- exclude softlock achievements
- exclude progression items from softlock and long playtime achievements
- traps replacing fillers probability

Additional Randomization:
- level completion Shapes
- upgrade Shapes
- vanilla toggle in Options
- complete random toggle in options
- progressive machine requirements (level 1-3 need only one machine,â€¦), can be toggeled to vanilla, can be
    toggeled to stretching
@code: look at vanilla levels after 26, stacked shapes need to have a full layer between two partial layers,
    mixed shape veins are ignored for logic, generate shapes with decision tree

Logical requirements:
- vertical half shapes > cutter
- horizontal half/quarter shapes > cutter, rotator
- shapes with different parts > cutter, stacker, rotator
- stacked shapes > stacker
- red, green, blue shapes > painter
- more colored shapes > painter, mixer
- goal > cutter, stacker, painter, mixer, balancer, rotator, tunnel, blueprints

Regions:
- Main > Levels with 1 Building, Levels with 5 Buildings, Upgrades Tier II,
         Cut Shape Achievements, Rotated Shape Achievements, Stacked Shape Achievements, Painted Shape Achievements,
         Stored Shape Achievements, Trashed Shape Achievements, Wiring Achievements
- Levels with 1 Building > Levels with 2 Buildings
- Levels with 2 Buildings > Levels with 3 Buildings
- Levels with 3 Buildings > Levels with 4 Buildings
- Levels with 4 Buildings > Levels with 5 Buildings
- Upgrades Tier II > Upgrades with 1 Building, Upgrades with 3 Building, Upgrades with 5 Buildings
- Upgrades with 1 Building > Upgrades with 2 Buildings
- Upgrades with 2 Buildings > Upgrades with 3 Buildings
- Upgrades with 3 Buildings > Upgrades with 4 Buildings, Upgrades with 5 Building
- Upgrades with 4 Buildings > Upgrades with 5 Buildings
- Cut Shape Achievements > All Buildings Shapes
- Rotated Shape Achievements > All Buildings Shapes
- Stacked Shape Achievements > All Buildings Shapes
- Painted Shape Achievements > All Buildings Shapes

Shapesanity:
- No stacking, up to 2 different kinds of parts, rotated versions excluded
- combinations of up to 2 kinds of shapes, with empty, but no empty-empty
- both sides have 1-3 parts with no empty space (except empty is one side)
- both sides can be in another color

@code Connection details:
- save login details in save file
- connect when loading save file, so not different overriding for different cases
- add login input box on main menu, creating save file takes that input, cancel loading file when no connection
- close connection on returning to main menu
- add button to save file in Main menu to change login details
- if connection lost, save the game and return to main menu
- load all items received offline
- save ordered list of received items in save file
- save index of last received item in save file
- playing offline is a nice idea but NOT PLANNED for initial release
- receive AP seed, buildings order logic, and options from server and use them to generate the save file

@code other details:
- no console input, need text client
- active mod = only playing AP
- create bare bone structure of code like in docs, then fill like other worlds
- all upgrades available from receiving upgrades unlock

Funny idea: randomize MUSIC
- unlocking background music shuffled into item pool
- one song always in starting inventory
- only randomized if achievements included

Oh god I have another idea: Languages
- Add choice option to choose language
- changes names of items and locations and maybe everything else that is a string
- rather easy to implement
