# Trackmania

## Where is the options page?

The player options page for this game can be found [here](../player-options) and contains all the options you need to configure and export a config .yaml file.

## How on Earth does a randomizer work for Trackmania?

That's a good question! This mode is similar to Flink's [Random Map Challenge](https://flinkblog.de/RMC/), but in the structure of the official campaigns. At the start of the game, you will have access to about 10 random maps from [Trackmania Exchange](https://trackmania.exchange/). Your goal is to beat your target time on each of these tracks. You can choose any medal, or any time between any two medals, as your target time. The quickest medal that is still slower than or equal to your target time is considered your progression medal. When you have the progression medals from 8 of the 10 tracks in a series, you can move on to the next series, which has an additional set of tracks. Once you have completed 5 series, you have won the randomizer! Of course, the number of maps in a series, the number of series, and your target time are all configurable on the [options page](../player-options).

The catch here is that all of your medals have been randomized! When you drive a run that beats a medal time, say the gold medal time for example, you will (probably) not get a gold medal. You will get a different medal, or an item from another player's game. Other players in your server will have to find your medals in their worlds in order for you to progress to the next series. Every medal time below your target time, as well as the target time itself, all count as "locations" that items from any world in the server can be in.

Some of the maps on Trackmania Exchange are incredibly difficult. If another player's important progression item has taken the place of the author medal on a track you cannot beat, there is still hope! There are a few map skip items that have been added to the item pool. When you use one, it will complete the currently loaded track and collect all the items that were on the map. Use them wisely, there aren't that many!
