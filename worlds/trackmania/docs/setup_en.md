## Connecting to an Archipelago Server

To connect to a server, simply run the **Archipelago Trackmania Client** from the **Archipelago Launcher**, and use the 
/connect command or the header bar to connect to the server. Once the client is connected to the server, you must connect the Trackmania Plugin to the client. In the Openplanet overlay, click Scripts -> Archipelago to open the Archipelago Plugin window, and click Connect.

## Client Console Commands

`/trackmania` - Reports if the client is connected to the Trackmania plugin

`/reroll` - Replaces the currently loaded map with a new one from Trackmania Exchange. This is intended to be used only if a map is broken, impossible, or you become soft-locked.

`/reroll <series_number> <map_number>` - Replaces the specified map with a new one from Trackmania Exchange. 
This is intended to be used from the main menu only if a map is impossible to load.
