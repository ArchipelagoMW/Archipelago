# Donkey Kong Country 3

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Items which the player would normally acquire throughout the game have been moved around. Logic remains, so the game is
always able to be completed, but because of the item shuffle the player may need to access certain areas before they
would in the vanilla game.

## What is the goal of Donkey Kong Country 3 when randomized?

There are two goals which can be chosen:
- `Knautilus`: Collect Bonus Coins and Krematoa Cogs to reach K. Rool's submarine in Krematoa
- `Banana Bird Hunt`: Collect Banana Birds to free the Banana Bird Mother

## What items and locations get shuffled?

All Bonus Coins, DK Coins, and Banana Birds (if on a `Banana Bird Hunt` goal) are randomized. Additionally, level clears award a location check.
The Patch and two Skis for upgrading the boat are included. Bear Coins are provided if additional items are needed for the item pool.
Four of the Five Krematoa Cogs are randomized, but the final one is always in its vanilla location at the Flag of Rocket Rush in Krematoa

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any shuffled item can be in other players' worlds.

## What does another world's item look like in Donkey Kong Country 3

Items pickups all retain their original appearance. You won't know if an item belongs to another player until you collect.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

Currently, the items are silently added to the player's inventory, which can be seen when saving the game.
