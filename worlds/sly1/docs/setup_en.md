# Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus Guide

## Required Software

- A legally obtained NTSC ISO of Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus
- [v1.6.0 of PCSX2](https://pcsx2.net/downloads)
    - Select show previous versions and choose v1.6.0
- The built-in Archipelago client, which can be installed [here](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases).

## Configuring your YAML file

### What is a YAML file and why do I need one?

Your YAML file contains a set of configuration options which provide the generator with information about how it should
generate your game. Each player of a multiworld will provide their own YAML file. This setup allows each player to enjoy
an experience customized for their taste, and different players in the same multiworld can all have different options.

### Where do I get a YAML file?

You can customize your options by visiting
the [Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus Options Page](/games/Sly%20Cooper%20and%20the%20Thievius%20Raccoonus/player-options).

### Connect to the MultiServer

1. Launch PCSX2 and boot your copy of Sly 1
    - You can also add various patch files (ie: Bentley Skipper)
    - Make sure you reload the patch files if you add them after booting the game
    - Patch files must also be named correctly for them to work properly
2. Launch SlyAP.exe from the client folder
    - Under address input your archipelago connection address (ie: archipelago.gg:51780)
    - PCSX2 must be open before the Sly client is opened or it will give an error
