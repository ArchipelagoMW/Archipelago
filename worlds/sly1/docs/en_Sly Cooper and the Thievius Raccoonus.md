# Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus (PS2)

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Every key, vault, master thief sprint, and episode intro is replaced with an archipelago item.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

28 Keys, 19 master thief moves, and 4 episodes can be found at every level end, every time you open the vault, and at every master thief sprint challenge. You can also find some extra 1-ups and charms or various traps.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any of the items which can be shuffled may also be placed into another player's world. It is possible to choose to limit
certain items to your own world.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

You will be able to use the master thief move or open any gate with any keys that you recieve. Murray will always be moved out of the way so you can view any episode but when you recieve an episode as an item, the intro level will be accessible. You may need to view a different episode if you recieve the episode item while viewing said episode.
