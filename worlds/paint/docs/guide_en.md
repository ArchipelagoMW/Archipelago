# Paint Randomizer Start Guide

After rolling your seed, go to the [Archipelago Paint](https://mariomantaw.github.io/jspaint/) site and enter the server
details, your slot name, and a room password if one is required. Then click "Connect". If desired, you may then load a
custom target image with File->Open. If playing asynchronously, it is recommended to leave the tab open to ensure drawing
progress is saved.
