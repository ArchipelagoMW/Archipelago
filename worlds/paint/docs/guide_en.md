# Paint Randomizer Start Guide

After rolling your seed, go to the [Archipelago Paint](https://mariomantaw.github.io/jspaint/) site and enter the
server details, your slot name, and a room password if one is required. Then click "Connect". If desired, you may then
load a custom target image with File->Open Goal Image. If playing asynchronously, note that progress is saved using the
hash that will appear at the end of the URL so it is recommended to leave the tab open or save the URL with the hash to
avoid losing progress.
