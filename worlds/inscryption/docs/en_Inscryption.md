# Inscryption

## Where is the settings page?
You can configure your player settings with the Inscryption settings page. [Click here](../player-settings) to start configuring them to your liking.

## What does randomization do to this game?
Due to the nature of the randomizer, you are allowed to return to a previous act you've previously completed if there are location checks you've missed. The "New Game" option is replaced with a "Chapter Select" option and is enabled after you beat act 1. If you prefer, you can also make all acts available from the start by changing the goal option. All items that you can find lying around, in containers or from puzzles are randomized and replaced with location checks. Boss fights from all acts and battles from act 2 also count as location checks.

## What is the goal of Inscryption when randomized?
By default, the goal is considered reached once you open the OLD_DATA file. This means playing through all three acts in order and the epilogue. You can change the goal option to instead complete all acts in any order or simply complete act 1.

## Which items can be in another player's world?
All key items necessary for progression such as the film roll, the dagger, Grimora's epitaphs, etc. Unique cards that aren't randomly found in the base game (e.g. talking cards) are also included. For filler items, you can receive currency which will be added to every act's bank or card packs that you can open at any time when inspecting your deck.

## What does another world's item look like in Inscryption?
Items from other worlds usually take the appearance of a normal card from the current act you're playing. The card's name contains the item that will be sent when picked up and its portrait is the Archipelago logo (a ring of six circles). Picking up these cards does not add them to your deck.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?
A yellow message appears in the Archipelago logs at the top-right of your screen. An audio cue is also played.
