## How is the game managed in Nightmare mode?
At death, the player has to restart a brand new game, giving him the choice to stay under the Nightmare mode or continuing with the Normal mode if considered too hard. In this case, all collected items won't appear on the map and will be redistributed in the inventory. In addition, if the option is enabled, all collected scraps are lost. However, those scraps can be found where the randomized items have already been collected (breaking the randomization only for the already collected items).

## What does another world's item look like in Choo-Choo Charles?
Any item or hint that cannot be normaly represented in the game is replaced by the miniaturized "DeathDuck" easter egg that can be seen out from the physical wall limits of the original game.

## How is the player informed by an item transmission and hints?
A message appears in game to inform what item is sent or received, including which world and what player the item comes from. The same method is used for hints.

## Is it possible to use hints in the game?
At any moment, the player can press one of the following keys to display a console in the game :
* "~" (querty)
* "Â²" (azerty)
* "F10"
Then, a hint can be revealed by typing "/hint [player] <item>".
