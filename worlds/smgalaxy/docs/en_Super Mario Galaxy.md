# Super Mario Galaxy

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

When it comes to Super Mario Galaxy, all Power Star and Grand Star locations are added to the location pool, and the items will be Grand Stars, which unlock the next dome location, and Power Stars, which will increase the power star count, which will progress towards galaxies and completing the center of the universe.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Power Stars and Grand Stars can be found in other players' worlds.

## What does another world's item look like in Super Mario Galaxy
<!-- This might be changed depending on what we decide to do later -->
Items belonging to other worlds will not look any different from how the location containing the item would look in vanilla.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

When receiving a Power Star, the Power Star counter in the top left of the screen will increase. When receiving a Grand Star, the next dome will unlock, the dome power in that area, and the power star counter will increase by 1. 
###### Quality of life:

- Major cutscenes will be skipped before the Center of the Universe.
