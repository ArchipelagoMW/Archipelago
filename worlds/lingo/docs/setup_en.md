# Lingo Randomizer Setup

## Required Software

- [Lingo](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1814170/Lingo/)
- [Lingo Archipelago Randomizer](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3092505110)

## Optional Software

- [Archipelago Text Client](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases)
- [Lingo AP Tracker](https://code.fourisland.com/lingo-ap-tracker/about/CHANGELOG.md)

## Installation

You can use the above Steam Workshop link to subscribe to the Lingo Archipelago Randomizer. This will automatically
download the client, as well as update it whenever an update is available.

If you don't want to use Steam Workshop, you can also
[download the randomizer manually](https://code.fourisland.com/lingo-archipelago/about/) using the instructions on the
linked page.

## Joining a Multiworld game

1. Launch Lingo
2. Click on Settings, and then Level. Choose Archipelago from the list.
3. Start a new game. Leave the name field blank (anything you type in will be
   ignored).
4. Enter the Archipelago address, slot name, and password into the fields.
5. Press Connect.
6. Enjoy!

To continue an earlier game, you can perform the exact same steps as above. You
do not have to re-select Archipelago in the level selection screen if you were
using Archipelago the last time you launched the game.

In order to play the base game again, simply return to the level selection
screen and choose Level 1 (or whatever else you want to play). The randomizer
will not affect gameplay unless you launch it by starting a new game while it is
selected in the level selection screen, so it is safe to play the game normally
while the client is installed.

**Note**: Running the randomizer modifies the game's memory. If you want to play
the base game after playing the randomizer, you need to restart Lingo first.
