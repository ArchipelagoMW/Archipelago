  # This file is an associative array where the keys are region names. Rooms
  # have four properties: entrances, panels, doors, and paintings.
  #
  # entrances is an array of regions from which this room can be accessed. The
  # key of each entry is the room that can access this one. The value is a list
  # of OR'd requirements for being able to access this room from the other one,
  # although the list can be elided if there is only one requirement, and the
  # value True can be used if there are no requirements (i.e. you always have
  # access to this room if you have access to the other). Each requirement
  # describes a door that must be opened in order to access this room from the
  # other. The door is described by both the door's name and the name of the
  # room that the door is in. The room name may be omitted if the door is
  # located in the current room.
  #
  # panels is an array of panels in the room. The key of the array is an
  # arbitrary name for the panel. Panels can have the following fields:
  # - id:            The internal ID of the panel in the LINGO map
  # - required_room: In addition to having access to this room, the player must
  #                  also have access to this other room in order to solve this
  #                  panel.
  # - required_door: In addition to having access to this room, the player must
  #                  also have this door opened in order to solve this panel.
  # - required_panel: In addition to having access to this room, the player must
  #                   also be able to access this other panel in order to solve
  #                   this panel.
  # - colors:        A list of colors that are required to be unlocked in order
  #                  to solve this panel
  # - check:         A location check will be created for this individual panel.
  # - exclude_reduce: Panel checks are assumed to be INCLUDED when reduce checks
  #                   is on. This option excludes the check anyway.
  # - tag:           Label that describes how panel randomization should be
  #                  done. In reorder mode, panels with the same tag can be
  #                  shuffled amongst themselves. "forbid" is a special value
  #                  meaning that no randomization should be done. This field is
  #                  mandatory.
  # - link:          Panels with the same link label are randomized as a group.
  # - subtag:        Used to identify the separate parts of a linked group.
  # - copy_to_sign:  When randomizing this panel, the hint should be copied to
  #                  the specified sign(s).
  # - achievement:   The name of the achievement that is received upon solving
  #                  this panel.
  # - non_counting:  If True, this panel does not contribute to the total needed
  #                  to unlock Level 2.
  # - hunt:          If True, the tracker will show this panel even when it is
  #                  not a check. Used for hunts like the Number Hunt.
  #
  # doors is an array of doors associated with this room. When door
  # randomization is enabled, each of these is an item. The key is a name that
  # will be displayed as part of the item's name. Doors can have the following
  # fields:
  # - id:             A string or list of internal door IDs from the LINGO map.
  #                   In door shuffle mode, collecting the item generated for
  #                   this door will open the doors listed here.
  # - painting_id:    An internal ID of a painting that should be moved upon
  #                   receiving this door.
  # - panels:         These are the panels that canonically open this door. If
  #                   there is only one panel for the door, then that panel is a
  #                   check. If there is more than one panel, then that entire
  #                   set of panels must be solved for a check. Panels can
  #                   either be a string (representing a panel in this room) or
  #                   a dict containing "room" and "panel".
  # - item_name:      Overrides the name of the item generated for this door.
  #                   If not specified, the item name will be generated from
  #                   the room name and the door name.
  # - item_group:     If set, this item will be in the specified item group.
  # - location_name:  Overrides the name of the location generated for this
  #                   door. If not specified, the location name will be
  #                   generated using the names of the panels.
  # - skip_location:  If true, no location is generated for this door.
  # - skip_item:      If true, no item is generated for this door.
  # - door_group:     When simple doors is used, all doors with the same group
  #                   will be covered by a single item.
  # - include_reduce: Door checks are assumed to be EXCLUDED when reduce checks
  #                   is on. This option includes the check anyway.
  # - junk_item:      If on, the item for this door will be considered a junk
  #                   item instead of a progression item. Only use this for
  #                   doors that could never gate progression regardless of
  #                   options and state.
  # - event:          Denotes that the door is event only. This is similar to
  #                   setting both skip_location and skip_item.
  #
  # paintings is an array of paintings in the room. This is used for painting
  # shuffling.
  # - id:             The internal painting ID from the LINGO map.
  # - enter_only:     If true, painting shuffling will not place a warp exit on
  #                   this painting.
  # - exit_only:      If true, painting shuffling will not place a warp entrance
  #                   on this painting.
  # - orientation:    One of north/south/east/west. This is the direction that
  #                   the player is facing when they are interacting with it,
  #                   not the orientation of the painting itself. "North" is
  #                   the direction the player faces at a new game, with the
  #                   positive X axis to the right.
  # - required_door:  This door must be open for the painting to be usable as an
  #                   entrance. If required_door is set, enter_only must be
  #                   True.
  # - required:       Marks a painting as being the only entrance for a room,
  #                   and thus it is required to be an exit when randomized.
  #                   Use "required_when_no_doors" instead if it would be
  #                   possible to enter the room without the painting in door
  #                   shuffle mode.
  # - req_blocked:    Marks that a painting cannot be an entrance leading to a
  #                   required painting. Paintings within a room that has a
  #                   required painting are automatically req blocked.
  #                   Use "req_blocked_when_no_doors" instead if it would be
  #                   fine in door shuffle mode.
  # - move:           Denotes that the painting is able to move.

      # to know this so that it can handle no door shuffle properly. So we split
