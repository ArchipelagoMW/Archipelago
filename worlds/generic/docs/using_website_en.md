# Using the Archipelago website to set up multiworlds

This guide describes how to generate and host multiworld games on the Archipelago website. This guide
should only take a few minutes to read.

## Generating, then hosting a multiworld on the website

First, make sure each player has their config files finished and saved to their computers.

1. Have one person collect each config file (for the rest of this guide, we'll assume you were the one who collected 
   them). Create a .zip file and put each config file inside.
2. Go to the ["Generate Game" page](/generate). Here, you can adjust some multiworld settings if you like.
3. Click on the Upload File button. A window will appear. Use it to find and select the .zip file you made.
   The page will refresh multiple times as it generates your multiworld.
   - After the generation completes, a Seed Info page will appear with some information about your multiworld.
4. To host a server for your multiworld, click on "Create New Room". The server will start!
   - Some players may need to download files to play in their worlds. The links to these files are on the server page.
     Be sure to share those links with the players who need them!
   - Explore the links and commands on this page to learn more about what you can do with the website!
   - Servers hosted on the website will stop running after 6 hours of inactivity. Refresh or reload the page to start
     the server again.
