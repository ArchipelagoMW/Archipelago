# Helpful Commands

Commands are split into two types: client commands and server commands. Client commands are commands which are executed
by the client and do not affect the Archipelago remote session. Server commands are commands which are executed by the
Archipelago server and affect the Archipelago session or otherwise provide feedback from the server.

In clients which have their own commands the commands are typically prepended by a forward slash: `/`. 

Server commands are always submitted to the server prepended with an exclamation point: `!`. <br/>

# Server Commands

Server commands may be executed by any client which allows for sending text chat to the Archipelago server. If your
client does not allow for sending chat then you may connect to your game slot with the TextClient which comes with the
Archipelago installation. In order to execute the command you need to merely send a text message with the command,
including the exclamation point.
