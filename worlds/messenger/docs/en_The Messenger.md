## What does randomization do in this game?

All items and upgrades that can be picked up by the player in the game are
randomized. The player starts in the Tower of Time HQ with the past section
finished, all area portals open, and with cloud step. You'll be forced to do
sections of the game in different ways with your current abilities.

## What items can appear in other players' worlds?

* The player's movement items
* Quest and pedestal items
* Music Box notes
* The Phobekins
* Time shards

## Where can I find items?

You can find items wherever items can be picked up in the original game. This
includes:
* Shopkeeper dialog where the player originally gains movement items
* Quest Item pickups
* Music Box notes
* Phobekins
* Power seals

## What are the item name groups?

When you attempt to hint for items in Archipelago you can use either the name
for the specific item, or the name of a group of items. Hinting for a group
will choose a random item from the group that you do not currently have and hint
for it. The groups you can use for The Messenger are:
* Notes - This covers the music notes
* Keys - An alternative name for the music notes
* Crest - The Sun and Moon Crests
* Phobekin - Any of the Phobekins
* Phobe - An alternative name for the Phobekins
* Shuriken - The windmill shuriken

## Other changes

* The player can return to the Tower of Time HQ at any point by selecting the
button from the options menu
    * This can cause issues if used at specific times. Current known:
        * During Boss fights
          * After Courage Note collection (Corrupted Future chase)
              * This is currently an expected action in logic. If you do need to teleport
during this chase sequence, it is recommended to quit to title and reload the save
* After reaching ninja village a teleport option is added to the menu to reach it
* Toggle Windmill Shuriken button is added to option menu once the item is received

## What do I do if I have a problem?

If you believe something happened that isn't intended, please get the `log.txt`
from the folder of your game installation and send a bug report either on github
or the [Archipelago Discord Server](http://archipelago.gg/discord)
