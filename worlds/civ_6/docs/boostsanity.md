## Boostsanity
Boostsanity takes all of the Eureka & Inspiration events and makes them location checks. This feature is the one to changeup the way Civilization is played in an AP multiworld/randomizer to date. What normally are mundane tasks that are passively collected now become a novel and interesting bucket list that you need to pay attention to  in order to unlock items for yourself and others!
Boosts have logic associated with them in order to verify you can always reach the ones you need to, when you need to. One side effect of this is that when boostsanity is enabled, previously some "Useful" items are now flagged as "Progression" (Urbanization, Pottery, The Wheel, to name a few).

### FAQs
- Someone sent me a tech/civic and I'm worried I won't be able to boost it anymore!
    - Fear not! The mod has been updated, and through a lot of wizardry üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è you will be able to boost civics/techs that have already been received. Additionally the UI has been updated to show you whether they have been boosted or not after receiving them still.
- I need to kill a unit with a slinger/archer/musketman or some other obsolete unit I can't build anymore, how can I do this??
    - Don't forget you can go into the Tech Tree and click on a Vanilla tech you've received in order to toggle it on/off. This is necessary in order to pursue some of the boosts if you receive techs in certain orders.
- Something happened and I'm not able to unlock the boost due to game rules!
    - A few scenarios you may worry about: "Found a religion", "Make an alliance with another player", "Develop an alliance to level 2", "Build a wonder from X Era", to name a few. Any boost that is "miss-able" has been flagged as an "Excluded" location and will not ever receive a progression item. For a list of how each boost is flagged, take a look [here](../data/boosts.json).
- I'm worried that my `PROGRESSIVE_ERA` item is going to be stuck in a boost I won't have time to complete before my maximum unlocked era ends!
    - I, too, have shared this fear. Due to the unpredictable timing of boosts and unlocking them, this could lead to a hard lock in certain scenarios. As a result, `PROGRESSIVE_ERA` items will never be located at a boost check.
- There's too many boosts, how will I know which one's I should focus on?!
    - In order to give a little more focus to all the boosts rather than just arbitrarily picking them at random, items in both of the vanilla trees will now have an advisor icon on them if it's associated boost contains a progression item.
