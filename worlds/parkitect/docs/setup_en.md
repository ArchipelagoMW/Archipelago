## Configuring your YAML file

### What is a YAML file and why do I need one?

You can leave this alone since it will be the same for every game so just delete this! I'm just here for explanations.

Your YAML file contains a set of configuration options which provide the generator with information about how it should
generate your game. Each player of a multiworld will provide their own YAML file. This setup allows each player to enjoy
an experience customized for their taste, and different players in the same multiworld can all have different options.

### Where do I get a YAML file?

You can customize your options by visiting the [Your Game Here Options Page](/games/Your%20Game%20Here/player-options).

Another hyperlink to the options page. The %20 in the link is a space. Make sure it matches the name you put for the your_game_here for the en_your_game_here.md doc.
