Just a file to remind myself to do things :D

# Fix the set rules method -> sometimes it cant fill fully
# Fix the ArchipelaShop in Parkitect -> missing GUID -> later version
# Coaster Goal adaption -> Either Intensity or Excitement - Done
# Exclude DLC Stuff! - Done

# Item Handling Weather Trap -> will re-appear on reconnecting - Should be fixed
# sometimes challenge do not add :(
# Goal coaster intensity + excitement not changed
