# ULTRAKILL

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

All weapons and arms are randomized. Extra abilities can also be randomized, including the ability to dash, walljump, slide, slam, and use a weapon's alternate fire.

Items are found by collecting secrets, and optionally by completing level challenges and getting Perfect Ranks.

Levels are unlocked by finding access to them within the multiworld. Levels can either be unlocked individually, or whole layers at once.

One level must be chosen as a goal for the randomizer, and a number of levels must be completed to unlock the goal. Completing secret missions and Prime Sanctums will also count. Prime Sanctums will never be considered in logic, unless chosen as the goal level.

Levels will be unlocked for all difficulties, and you can switch difficulties at any time.

Skulls can also be randomized, meaning they will not appear in any levels until found in the multiworld.

Note that the logic for the randomizer assumes that the player is willing to take intentional damage to get items.
