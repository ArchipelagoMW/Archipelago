# Browser API stubs

This folder contains partial stubs for `browser` API
[as defined by Brython](https://brython.info/static_doc/3.12/en/browser.html).

This allows auto-complete in IDEs as well as static analysis using mypy.

Since the Brython's `browser` package does not actually exist on the host side,
this is an actual package here.
