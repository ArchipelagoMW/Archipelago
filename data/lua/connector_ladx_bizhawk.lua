-- This script attempts to implement the basic functionality needed in order for
-- the LADXR Archipelago client to be able to talk to BizHawk instead of RetroArch
-- by reproducing the RetroArch API with BizHawk's Lua interface.
--
-- RetroArch UDP API: https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch/blob/master/command.c
--
-- Only
--  VERSION
--  GET_STATUS
--  READ_CORE_MEMORY
--  WRITE_CORE_MEMORY
-- commands are supported right now.
--
-- USAGE:
--  Load this script in BizHawk ("Tools" -> "Lua Console" -> "Script" -> "Open Script")
--
-- All inconsistencies (like missing newlines for some commands) of the RetroArch
-- UDP API (network_cmd_enable) are reproduced as-is in order for clients written to work with
-- RetroArch's current API to "just work"(tm).
--
-- This script has only been tested on GB(C). If you have made sure it works for N64 or other
-- cores supported by BizHawk, please let me know. Note that GET_STATUS, at the very least, will
-- have to be adjusted.
--
--
-- NOTE:
--  BizHawk's Lua API is very trigger-happy on throwing exceptions.
--  Emulation will continue fine, but the RetroArch API layer will stop working. This
--  is indicated only by an exception visible in the Lua console, which most players
--  will probably not have in the foreground.
--
--  pcall(), the usual way to catch exceptions in Lua, doesn't appear to be supported at all,
--  meaning that error/exception handling is not easily possible.
--
--  This means that a lot more error checking would need to happen before e.g. reading/writing
--  memory. Since the end goal, according to AP's Discord, seems to be SNI integration of GB(C),
--  no further fault-proofing has been done on this.
