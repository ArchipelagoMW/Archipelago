# this file has to be in the Players folder to take effect, keeping the "meta.yaml" name.
# A meta file rolls its own set of options first
# the result will then overwrite each player's option in that particular field
# for example, if a meta.yaml fast_ganon result is rolled, every player will have that fast_ganon goal
# there is the special case of null, which ignores that part of the meta.yaml,
# allowing for a chance for that meta to not take effect
# players can also have a meta_ignore option to ignore specific options
# example of ignore that would be in a player's file:
# meta_ignore:
#   world_state:
#     inverted
#this means, if world_state is meta-rolled and the result happens to be inverted, then defer to the player's yaml instead.
