## History

Archipelago is built upon a strong legacy of brilliant hobbyists. We want to honor that legacy by showing it here.
The repositories which Archipelago is built upon, inspired by, or otherwise owes its gratitude to are:

* [bonta0's MultiWorld](https://github.com/Bonta0/ALttPEntranceRandomizer/tree/multiworld_31)
* [AmazingAmpharos' Entrance Randomizer](https://github.com/AmazingAmpharos/ALttPEntranceRandomizer)
* [VT Web Randomizer](https://github.com/sporchia/alttp_vt_randomizer)
* [Dessyreqt's alttprandomizer](https://github.com/Dessyreqt/alttprandomizer)
* [Zarby89's](https://github.com/Ijwu/Enemizer/commits?author=Zarby89)
  and [sosuke3's](https://github.com/Ijwu/Enemizer/commits?author=sosuke3) contributions to Enemizer, which make up the
  vast majority of Enemizer contributions.

We recognize that there is a strong community of incredibly smart people that have come before us and helped pave the
path. Just because one person's name may be in a repository title does not mean that only one person made that project
happen. We can't hope to perfectly cover every single contribution that lead up to Archipelago, but we hope to honor
them fairly.

### Path to the Archipelago

Archipelago was directly forked from bonta0's `multiworld_31` branch of ALttPEntranceRandomizer (this project has a
long legacy of its own, please check it out linked above) on January 12, 2020. The repository was then named to
_MultiWorld-Utilities_ to better encompass its intended function. As Archipelago matured, then known as
"Berserker's MultiWorld" by some, we found it necessary to transform our repository into a root level repository
(as opposed to a 'forked repo') and change the name (which came later) to better reflect our project.

## Running Archipelago
