# Ship of Harkinian + Archipelago

## What is this?

This is for the Archipelago integration in Ship of Harkinian. For now, a separate version of SoH will have to be downloaded to play this, but eventually this page will only contain the .apworld needed to play AP in Ship. 

If you need more info about AP in SoH in general, please take a look at our [overview doc](https://github.com/HarbourMasters/Archipelago-SoH/blob/oot-soh/worlds/oot_soh/docs/en_Ship%20of%20Harkinian.md).

If you need more info about how to play AP in SoH, follow our [setup guide](https://github.com/HarbourMasters/Archipelago-SoH/blob/oot-soh/worlds/oot_soh/docs/guide_en.md).

You can [find our releases here](https://github.com/HarbourMasters/Archipelago-SoH/releases).

Looking for more info about Archipelago in general? Check out their [website](https://archipelago.gg/) or [GitHub page](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago).
